Having a creative soul and loving fashion, is having to think through how to match colours, fabrics, patterns, the geometrical shapes, then also having to check the weather, the seasons the trends, the upcoming talented designers. 

Being up to date with the latest trends, by viewing fashion shows in Milan, Paris, Tokyo, NYC, London, by reading fashion blogs and get THAT magical and timeless item that will make your outfit go marverlously. 

As a fashion lover, I love to draw on my ipad, and imagine which dress I will wear for a special event. To tune that specific piece with the appropriate accessories, shoes, jewels, haircut, makeup. I always let my trustworthy imagination runs,
to coordinate impeccably my outfits üòÉ.


I always have that mission in mind: dress to kill. 

Fashion is just my VIBE. I am not afraid to express that side of myself.

 Going out with a sexy and bold attire, feels like a walk in a park for me.

Weather and trends are indeed among my picking components, but I also chose my clothes according to my moods. 

One day, I get to feel like dressing in a very girlish way, very pinky, with a full-blown hollywood style makeup fake eyelashes, and my Louboutin stilettos on - and the other, I get to go out with the absolute and most tom boyish attire ever: XXL punk rock t-shirt (stole from boyfriend üòÉ), with a torn-up to pieces 3/4 boyfriend jean, and platform Dr. Martens boots.

I just go with how my mind decides to flow at the moment. 

My fashion moods are hugely intertiwned with my highly various musical inspirations. 

As my music taste is very ecclectic, that contains a wide range of various music genres, from different period eras, all around the world, my fashion statements naturally follow in consequences.

As I draw clothes and outfits, go shopping, or get the outfit to go outside, the other part of my cerebral cortex picks up in the meantime, the inspirational sources, through the leadsinger from a grunge band, through that sensual and ethereal r&b singer or 
 through a 70's Motown disco group.

 That is how intersectional and transversal art is for me.

 That is one of the reason that I love to create so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
