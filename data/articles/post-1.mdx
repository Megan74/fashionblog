Having a creative soul and loving fashion, is having to think through how to match colours, fabrics, patterns, the geometrical shapes, then also having to check the weather, the seasons the trends, the upcoming talented designers. 

Being up to date with the latest trends by viewing fashion shows in Milan, Paris, Tokyo, NYC, London, by reading fashion blogs and get THAT magical and timeless item that will make your outfit go marverlously. 

As a fashion lover, I love to draw on my ipad and imagine which dress I will wear for a special event. To tune that specific piece with the appropriate accessories, shoes, jewels, haircut, makeup. I always let my trustworthy imagination runs
to coordinate impeccably my outfits üòÉ.


I always have that mission in mind: dress to killüí•. 

Fashion is just my VIBE. I am not afraid to express that side of myself.

 Going out with a sexy and bold attire, feels like a walk in a park for me.

Weather and trends are indeed among my picking components, but I also chose my clothes according to my moods. 

One day, I get to feel like dressing in a very girlish way, very pinky with a full-blown hollywood style makeup and fake eyelashes, plus my Louboutin stilettos on - and the other, I get to go out with the absolute and most tomboyish attire ever: XXL punk rock t-shirt (stole from boyfriend üòÉ), with a torn-up to pieces 3/4 boyfriend jean, plus Dr. Martens platform boots.

I just go with how my mind decides to flow at the moment. 

My fashion moods are hugely intertiwned with my highly various musical inspirations, and the extremely rich afro-carribean culture that impacts entirely our modern society. 

As my music taste and cultural background and interest, are very ecclectic, containing a wide range of various music genres from different period eras and all around the world, my fashion statements naturally follow that direction.

As I draw clothes and outfits, go shopping, or get the perfect outfit to go outside, the other part of my cerebral cortex picks up in the meantime the inspirational sources, through the leadsinger from an indie rock band, through that sensual and ethereal neosoul music singer or 
 through a 70's Motown disco/funk group.

 That is how multidimensional and transversal art.

 That is one of the reason that I love to create so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
