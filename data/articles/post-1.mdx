Having a creative soul and loving fashion, is having to think through how to match colours, fabrics, patterns, the geometrical shapes, then also having to check the weather, the seasons the trends, the upcoming talented designers. 

Being up to date with the latest trends, by visioning fashion shows in Milan, Paris NYC, London, by reading fashion blogs and get THAT magical piece that will make your outfit go marverlously. 

As a fashion lover, I love to draw and imagine which dress I will wear for a special event. Tune that special piece with the appropriate accessories, shoes, jewels. keep imagining how my outfits will be coordinated impeccably. 
Keep imagining a way to dress to kill if you will. 

Fashion is just my VIBE. I am not afraid to express that side of myself. Going out with a sexy and bold attire, feels like a walk in a park for me.

Weather and trends are indeed among my picking components, but I also chose my clothes according to my moods at the time. 

One day, I get to feel dressing very girly, very pinky and the other, I get to go out with the absolute and most tom boyish attire ever: XXL punk rock t-shirt (stole from boyfriend) design with a torn-up to pieces 3/4 boyfriend jean and platform Dr. Martens.

I just go with how my mind decides to flow at the moment. My fashion moods are intertiwned with my various musical inspirations. 

As my music tastes are very ecclectic and contain a wide range of various music genres, from different period eras, my fashion choices do go the same.

As I draw clothes, go shopping, or get the outfit to go outside, the other part of my cortex brain picks in the meantime, the inspiration through the leadsinger from a grunge band, from that sensual r&b singer or 
 from a 70s motown disco group.

 That is how intersectional and transversal art is, and is also one of the reason that I love to create so much. ❤️❤️❤️
