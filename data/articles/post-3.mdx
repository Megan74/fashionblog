Soo where to begin üòÉ

Un peu d'histoire: 

The 70s period era is a cultural reset, on E-V-E-R-Y aspect.<br></br>
Indeed, up until the end of the 60s, minimalism and conformism were paradigms that were deeply rooted
in the western societies. Thereupon many social risings and social outbursts, have emerged right before the 70's era arrives, marking a true breaking point:

‚Ä¢ The Civil Rights movement was striking in the United States, at that moment: the Afro-american community fought, marched, protested, for equality.
They never rested until the US governement ends its arbitrary legal system, that constantly and unfairly targeted them.

‚Ä¢ The Cold-War was at that time, raging for two long decades already, opposing the Western bloc (USA and Europe plus its colonized countries) vs the Eastern bloc (China and USSR). The nuclear crisis in Cuba, the Vietnam war that was still ongoing, the two Coreas war, the soft power struggle between the two blocs, 
all of these tragic events, were occuring in a very very short time span. Consequently, students, professors, intellectuals, anti-war citizens, accross the United-States, Europe and particularly 
in France, showed their extreme anger and exhaustion of these unfair wars overseas, of the political conservative agenda influenced by the american imperialism, of the systemic racism, and the european colonialism. 

The 60s was a true social flashpoint that caused at the end of its decade, a few positive outcomes. After long years of protests for their rights to
be recognized and protected, the Afro-American community, finally received a legislative milestone : indeed, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Jim-Crow-law"> the Jim Crow laws </a>, that legalized racial segregations, hence systemic abuses against that oppressed community for centuries, had been abrogated by the Kennedy administration in 1964.

Wars, imperialism, capitalism, social injustices, poverty.. people rised and demanded Change and Justice.
These new promulgated legislations, pushing positive social changes, offered a few inches of freedom to minorities and the most vulnerable part of society.  

The 70s then slowly arrived and brought with them to start the decade in a new lens, a whole fresh new movement: brand new musics, innovative outfits and unique new designs. That cultural reset
drawn a distinct line between the traumatizing past and the future - to finally move on. EVER since, the global cultural DNA has been transitioned forever.‚ù§Ô∏è

Culturally, artistically, the 70s era was an immense inspirational source to say the least. The disco music was created at that period in New York: that new genre 
characterized by an up-beat and groovy tempo, was specifically created to dance and escape from the dark reality, especially when you were a minority. Indeed, disco was at first played by disc jockeys in gay bars/night clubs.
That incredibly catchy music, fastly started to become a real phenomenon. Grace Jones, Liza Minnelli, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Salvadore Dali, John Travolta, Bianca Jagger, Andy Warhol, Diana Ross and many others celebrites, had to reunite to New York at least once to the most infamous and exclusive night club ever, to D-A-N-C-E until the sun rises: <a href="https://cfda.com/news/cfda-decades-the-seventies-disco-glitter-studio-54"> the Studio 54 </a>. 
Detroit, industrial city in Michigan, is not only known for being the giant General Motor's fiefdom, but it is also known to be a real music talent factory. Indeed, Motown record music founded by Berry Gordy (ex Marvin Gaye's brother-in-law üò≥) in Detroit in 1959, has ever since its creation, signed the most prominent music artists the planet has ever known.
Motown represented artists like : the Jackson 5, The Commodores, Rick James, the Supremes, the Temptations, Earth Wind and Fire, Donna Summer.
And with the disco music entering into the world's ears, the Motown made sure to represent most of the biggest disco/funk bands ever. Until this day, the Music Royalties, copyrights, publications from these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_s9QFJUTZ4">iconic songs </a>, are still cashing-in into Motown üí∞. 


When I evoked innovative outfits the 70s had offered us, I meant that this decade had visually brought a whole new fashion stratospheric dimension. Passing from the discrete black or white, minimalist outfits... To looooong flare velvet plants, colourful and eye-catching pattern blouses with immense collars, unisex heels platform boots. To maximalist fashion concepts in every details: accessories, jewelleries, whimsical buckle belts
Afros and hair blowouts to die for. 
The 70s, displayed a spectacularly way to approch fashion. The vibrating and daring outfits were so impactful, that the biggest fashion design houses are still inspired by that time period,
to create their high-end & hand-made pieces, for their collections: Valentino, Gucci, Yves Saint-Laurent, Versace, to name a few.

So YES the 70s, have a huge place in my heart in terms of culture and fashion. My loooong purple flare pants, my extravaganza golden supa high heels, that I love to wear with a jumpsuit and a bandana in my hair, with tons of golden jewelleries, can absolutely testify üòÅ.
I literally cannot count the amount of colourful 70s inspired crop-tops, that I have in my closet. I never felt so hot and more feminine, than when I curl my hair to get the same blowout as Donna Summer and Farrah Fawcett. There is not a day when I am not 100 decibels blasting in my car, 
The Temptations, the Gap Band, some Curtis Mayfield or Chaka Khan. 

The 70s is my FAVOURITE cultural era, hands down. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
