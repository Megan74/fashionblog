            <p className="pb-2">Hi, I am Megan!<br></br>
             A 30 yearls old bubbly fashion enthusiast<br></br>
             Ever since I am a kid, conformity has always been a concept 
             I have struggled to grasp my head around, stubborn and with a very big imagination
             my goals have always been centered around the rules that I will create, despite society
             and its very perspicuous codes. Hence, I have naturally been drawn to art and creativity in every aspect. 
             In that univers, NO rules, NO restrictive access, NO judgement, either you feel, either you see the world, whoever you are
            
            For me that unconventionel power spread colours flavour in a capitalistic and cold world, where social strats and etiquettes prevail.

            The beauty in art, is that a creation touches the humans soul, matter your social background/sexual orientation/political or religious beliefs.

            It is powerful,timeless, unifiying and has a healing power.
