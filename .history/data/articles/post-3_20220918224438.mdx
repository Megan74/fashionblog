Soo where to begin ðŸ˜ƒ

Un peu d'histoire: 

The 70s period era is itself a cultural reset, on E-V-E-R-Y aspects. Indeed, up until the end of the 60s, minimalism and conformism were paradigms that
rules mostly western societies. Many social risings and outbursts emerged right before the 70S arrive.

Civil Rights were striking at that moment in the United States. The black community fought, marched, protested, for equality
and to end the arbitrary legal system, that was constantly and unfairly targetting them. The Cold-War raging against the Western bloc (USA and Europe and its colonzed countries) vs the East bloc (China and USSR), for two long decades now. 

The uclear crisis in Cuba, the Vietnam war that was still ongoing, the two Coreas war, the soft power struggle between the two blocs, all of these events were occuring in a very very short time span time. Consequently, students, professors, intellectuals all accross the United-States, Europe and particurlaly 
in France, showed their extreme anger and exhaustness of these unfair wars overseas, the political conservative agenda influenced with the american imperialism, and the systemic racism, and colonialism. The 60s was a social flashpoint that caused positive outcomes for
the black community in America, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Jim-Crow-law"> the Jim Crow laws </a> legalizing racial segregations and systemic abuse against them for centuries, had finally being abrogated by the Kennedy administration in 1964.
