Nothing inspires me more than strong, successful women. But for a very long time, that archetype has only been limited to the image gravitating towards men wearing their power suits, calling the shots in board rooms.
Me, I am more drawn into the image of the Seductress, the Bombshell. A Goddess women who have reached the top, by breaking molds and that have fully embraced their sexual allure.

These molds were specifically designed for women. Societal boxes with patriarchal features, that gave women limited life purposes: being a wife, mother.

" We teach girls to shrink themselves<br></br>
To make themselves smaller<br></br>
We say to girls<br></br>
“You can have ambition<br></br>
But not too much<br></br>
You should aim to be successful<br></br>
But not too successful<br></br>
Otherwise you will threaten the man”<br></br>
Because I am female<br></br>
I am expected to aspire to marriage<br></br>
I am expected to make my life choices<br></br>
Always keeping in mind that<br></br>
Marriage is the most important<br></br>
Now marriage can be a source of<br></br>
Joy and love and mutual support<br></br>
But why do we teach to aspire to marriage<br></br>
And we don’t teach boys the same?<br></br>
We raise girls to each other as competitors<br></br>
Not for jobs or for accomplishments<br></br>
Which I think can be a good thing<br></br>
But for the attention of men<br></br>
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings<br></br>
In the way that boys are<br></br>
Feminist: the person who believes in the social<br></br>
Political, and economic equality of the sexes "<br></br>


Does this insightful speech is familiar to you? Yes? Exactly, it is the introduction of Beyonce “Flawless” ’s song, launched 10 years ago. 
A sample directly pulled from the Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s TEDxTalk speech held in London: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc"> « We Should All be Feminists.» </a>.
A speech that perfectly underlines the society's endoctrinations of young girls.

Let’s crop the historical timeline, from the 20th century to now.

At the beginning of that time period and for very long decades, worldwide societies boxed women into one tiny little square, that had attributed to them one role and only : being a wife. That indoctrination perpetuated early in girls' education, has placed the woman's existence around men. 
Not around herself as an individual humain being capable of critical thinking, possessing her own hobbies, aspirations, ambitions etc. No not at all. 
Her sole identity was to be a mother, to be a wife, which is ok, but many of these women during that time period, were trapped into a destructive societal box. An abusive, unchosen, unloved, unfulfilling prison, with no way out.

Society, had purposely silenced women, prevented them from expressing themselves, from complaining, from showing any relent of negative emotions, unless is gratefulness. 
The « Glorious Thirties » period,  accentuated that phenomenon, and gaslit on high scale the women’s unfair conditions, with advertisement campaigns pushing the image of the happy housewife receiving a brand new washing machine, and other revolutionary kitchen devices, to facilitate her cleaning/cooking tasks. 
On top that that tiny little square they spent all their lives in, women were stripped down from their rights to vote. If they had the possibility to work they could, but they were not allowed to access to any roles with high responsibilities nor decisions-making positions. They had to tolerate constant harassment (sexually & psychologically at work, in silence without any repercussions. 
For a very long time, Society shoved brutal values into women’s throat, and forced them to nod their head, smile and being grateful to get the life patriarchy has chosen for them. The Happy housewife image displayed in every billboards, cover magazines, TV commercials, was a very toxic narrative, that pushed many of them to depression, alcoholism, pain killers anti-anxiolytic addictions, 
to numb their extreme despair, solitude, and fill the misery the society has pushed them in.

« The Stepford Wives », a novel book written by Ira Levin in 1972, decrypts exactly that sad phenomenon on a satyrical tone. Joanna Eberhart, a talented photographer, wife and young mother decides to move to Stepford, a Connecticut suburb, with her hubby and kids. 
In Joanna’s new town's idyllic facade, lies a terrible secret: she suspects the submissive housewives to be robots created by their husbands..


Since the beginning of the XXth century, women fought for their human rights. The Suffragettes, fought for women to participate in the political landscape. Women fought to create their own lanes at their reputations’ & lives’ expense, so the future generations can have the freedom to become whoever they want to be, without letting society and its patriarcal’s tentacles ostracises them. 
Considered for decades as breeding stock, as home-task programming robot (cf: Stepford wives), these deeply hurtful narratives are finally and progressively been dismantled. Thanks to the life-long feminists activists, human rights advocates and also thanks to influential women, that were absolutely not afraid to speak up, break societal codes and fight against Giants. 

The women’ fate has immensely evolved throughout the cultural lens, thanks to many public figures that I have a tremendous respect for. 

Josephine Baker was born in 1906, into the impoverished and racist suburb area of St. Louis, Missouri. She dropped out of school at 13 and supported herself by waitressing and dancing in the streets. By the age of 15, she was already divorced twice. Yet despite her dismal youth, she maintained an optimistic view about her future.
She eventually ended up to New York City during the Harlem Renaissance. Here she performed in a number of clubs and Broadway theatres, where she became “the highest-paid chorus girl in vaudeville.” 
Throughout it all, Baker remained driven and impassioned by her love of the stage and dance, which she performed with uninhibited erotic zeal. According to her sister, Margaret, she had "set out to conquer the world."  
For over a century, Black women performers have challenged racism, sexism, and heteronormativity. The ephemeral traces of historical performances from black women and their existences, have always been in danger of erasure or misinterpretation.
 In the 1920s and 1930s, Josephine Baker both shocked and delighted audiences at Parisian dance halls, with her scandalous banana belt. For many critics, the belt symbolizes her submission to primitivist caricature and racial/sexual objectification. 
Her dancing with that banana belt, was indeed a provocative way to criticize, how Brown women were percieved during the colonial era. Josephine managed to spark racial and sexual discourses, by dancing erotically & inhibited in front of a frenzied audience.
 Thanks to Joséphine, the banana belt controversy, offers the contemporary critics, a multidimensional, dialogic space for dismantling racial and sexual hierarchies.
Joséphine is a historical figure that is indeed well-known for her creativity & boldness, but also for her activism during the Second World War ; 2 years before the war started, she obtained the French nationality. During the war, she sang for the soldiers before becoming a secret agent of "La France Libre". She then joined the french air force as a second lieutenant.
Close to the Licra (International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism), she became its spokesperson, and used her notoriety to fight against racism. When she died in 1975, France awarded her military honors for her acts of resistance as a counterintelligence agent, that helped the nation to win against Hitler and the Axis army.
Mrs. Baker, representing symbol of freedom, activism and anti-racism, has entered last year on the 30th November, into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y367h9GuvLI"> the Panthéon Paris</a>. 


In a similar vein as Baker, Eartha Kitt famous actress and singer, broke the mold, she was also intially put in. She created her own lane where she followed her own rules. The "Santa Baby" singer, was so much more than a captivating entertainer, she was also a Civil Rights advocate, an international political provocateur whose career was nearly ruined after she condemned the Vietnam War.
Indeed, as a subversive black icon, Eartha empowered and inspired many. Any of her public political stances, would be immediately followed, and decrypted. By being fearlessly outspoken, and openly criticising controversial political measures led by the US government, as the Vietnam war that was raging at that moment, and pointing out how destructive and unnecessary that political choice was, the CIA put her on their watchlist.
They knew how jeopardizing her public statements can be against the White house agenda. Yes that is how POWERFUL & INFLUENTIAL Mrs Kitt was. « The most exciting woman of the world » as the Citizen Kane movie director, Orson Welles, loved to describe her, was born in a slavery plantation in South Carolina, in january 1927. 9 months after her mother a slave, had been raped by her master.. 
Her life trajectory took ever since an incredible and miraculous turn, as she becomes a symbol representing sex positivity, feminism and fight for any type of justice. 

Josephine, Eartha, paved an unimaginable path to desperate, unfulfilled, bored yet intrepid and incredibly smart women all over the world, that felt chained and lost into a patriarchal prison. Marylin Monroe followed as well these pioneers in the entertaining industry. And as her predecessors, she also broke the codes and followed her own destiny. 
She was not the « brainless blondie broad » that was only used and marketed for men. She was extremely smart, thought real quick out of the box, and knew how to control efficiently her image. The kind of fiery personality that is way ahead of her time. 
 At the time, racial segregation was still legal, but it has not stopped Monroe to use her power and notoriety, to help her friend, Ella Fitzgerald jazz music singer. She used her fame and redirected all the spotlight to Ella's art and immense talent. Indeed, Ella Fitzgerald, was struggling getting live performance gigs in exclusive jazz clubs, due to the colour of her skin and her prominent body figure. 
 Marylin became aware of her friend’s unfair treatment, called the jazz music club's owners, and asked them to let Ella perform in exchange of her, coming to most of her live shows with many of her famous circle, from her carnet d’address 😎. 
 Even the most racist, most misogynistic owner would be absolutely stupid, to turn down such a gigantic opportunity. Receiving that amount of publicity and spotlight to their establishments by being associated with the sexiest & most talked-about woman of all time, is a once in a lifetime shot that no one can refuses.
  Thanks to Marylin and her fearless mind, Ella's career trajectory took another dimension. Marylin’s allyship, and their sincere friendship, finally gave to Ella the recognition and respect she truly deserves. The clueless blonde stereotype, that the media loved to portray all her life, and career, was certainly overplayed. Marylin was more than what magazines, tabloids, depicted her to be. 
  Indeed, as she became a global sensation, she absolutely knew with who she will establish partnerships, and how to associate her "Bombshell" image, for post-mortem prosperity: she became the face of the worlwide perfume besteller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEHOBCt-JR0">Chanel n°5 </a>. A must-have item launched by a prominent french haute-couture house. She became the parisian house ambassador, right after her daring Life magazine <a href="/article/post-5">interview</a>. 
A true public relation machine, Monroe collaborated with the big names in every creative fields, from the french designer Thierry Mugler, the celebrity photographer Andy Warhol, the biggest film directors as Alfred Hitchcock, who once said «  Marylin has sex written all over her face ». Marilyn Monroe is an actress that has stayed in the spotlight across all generations. 
Monroe belongs to that wave of women, unapologetically using their sexuality as a tool in creativity.

During the 70s, a whole new genre of movies directed and produced by black people and for black people emerged: the Blaxploitation. These produtions became few years later, box-office smash across the United-States. The « Blaxploitation », alternative to Hollywood, had produced highly entertaining (but poorly written though) movies like Shaft, Blacula, etc. 
Thanks to that new artistic wave, a trans-generational icon is born: Pam Grier ladies and gentlemen 😍. Grier, became the Blaxploitation’s face, a forever sex-symbol, a Black woman that whole generations fantasised over. She rapidly became the most popular movie star of her era. 
With her voluptuous bodyfigure, Pam only signed up for characters that were fearless, pugnacious and bewitching. Fierce movie characters that would not hesitate to kick some bad guys asses, in a nylon jumpsuit with a mesmerising cleavage, plus huge platform boots. 
I mean there you have it, the perfect combination of all the ingredients to make a successful movie. Tarantino himself, the multi Oscar-awarded but very strict and exclusive movie director, had also been seduced by Pam’s career and charisma. He immediately picked her in 1997, to film his movie, "Jackie Brown", inspired by the Blaxpoitation storylines’ concept.
As Marylin Monroe, Pam embodies that powerful, irresistible woman, that had kicked the patriarchal's door down, and had created the life she has decided for herself. By being fearless, and unapologetic, these women have inspired and empowered young girls who had nobody to identify to. 

The Bombshells throughout history, such as Anna Nicole Smith, Pamela Anderson, Madonna and their spiritual mother Marylin Monroe, have owned their sexual & sensuality power, and then have turnt it into a veritable WEAPON.
They have spent all their lives breaking codes, wrecking chains, that had imprisoned the previous generations. 

These pop culture icons, not only broke social barriers, they have also inspired generations and generations of women, to not accept to be put into colourless, flavourless molds until the rest of their lives. They have paved a way to unapologetically embrace our sexuality and inner fierceness, even though it can make others uncomfortable. 
 Without feeling an inch of guilt, without having to feel  vilified by a part of society, who already have sealed the women’s fate, to fit their agenda or a narrative.

As a woman, born into african culture with conservative and church led values, that center our education around social shaming, having an extrovert, creative personality was complicated.
 I have somewhat felt guilt for not wanting to fit into that tiny little square that was designed for me. But by growing up, I quickly understood that there were many other ways to be happy, and fulfilled, than whatever the society, african culture, religion, had kept on and on ever since, we are young girls. 
The confident, bold, sharp & strong-minded woman that I am today, has been shaped up and molded thanks to these amazing public female figures, thanks to my strong and incredibly smart mother that is a force of a nature, and thanks to all the intelligent independent women in her family’s side. ❤️
