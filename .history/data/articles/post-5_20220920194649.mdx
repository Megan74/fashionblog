France Food Fashion  🇫🇷🇫🇷

The french international reach is marked by its sophisticated gastronomy and its fashion history.

Paris is named the fashion capital, for a reason. The City of Lights, hosts the most prestigious high end fashion houses ever created. 
Among them, has a particular place in my heart : maison Chanel.

The historical house was created in Paris, by Gabrielle "Coco" Chasnel. Though her first boutique was opened in Deauville in 1913, 
As World wars occured, Coco Chanel development activities was pretty difiicult, though she managed to opened a store in Biarritz and few years later in Paris.
The Chanel founder, was not only famous her clothing line, but also thanks to perfume she had launched in 1921, "Chanel n°5". That is one of world perfume bestseller.

We cannot evoke maison Chanel without talking about its signature centrepiece: the tweed suit. That emblematic two-piece set had been introduced in 1925.
The Chanel suit was worn by influential and fashionable women such as Princess Diana, Jackie Kennedy. 
Inspired by sportswear, the iconic course tweed fabric used in the detailed crafting of Chanel suits was initially not considered a glamorous textile. Tweed was primarily manufactured in Scottish twill mills, where Chanel discovered the true diversity of the fabric. 
Chanel’s passion for feminizing tweed by implementing new colors, materials, and textures to the then-underutilized fabric took the fashion world by storm, inspiring other French couturiers to employ her methods. 
The slim skirt and collarless jacket dubbed “Chanel’s uniform” became widely known with the help of press coverage, specifically a magazine image of actress Ina Claire dressed in a Chanel suit printed in 1924.

Karl Lagerfeld 
The German-born Karl Lagerfeld was appointed creative director in 1983, few years after Gabrielle Chanel passed away.  
Lagerfeld assumed the role with respect for the traditions of the house, retaining several items and methods intrinsic to the brand’s identity. His vision aligned with the Chanel’s DNA, to propel the brand towards avant-garde fashion. 
Lagerfeld wished to move Chanel away from the pastel-colored boxy suits of the 50s and drive Chanel into the 80s.
Lagerfeld gradually began making slight changes to the timeless piece, all the while keeping in mind the power and popularity of Chanel’s original idea. 
As the result of a high price tag, Lagerfeld understood the mature appeal towards the suited style and aspired to rejuvenate the idea of the iconic item. He created suits from denim, punk-style tweed, and bright neon wool, paired with tweed bralettes and even some Chanel alpine skis.
 He did it little-by-little, noting at the time that, “Even if she never did it this way, it’s very Chanel, no?” Lagerfeld was an innovator, he tapped muses and ’90s supermodels including Claudia Schiffer, Christy Turlington, Vanessa Paradis, and Linda Evangelista for campaigns and fashion shows, challenging the more conservative past of Chanel.
