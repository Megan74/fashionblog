France Food Fashion  🇫🇷🇫🇷

The french international reach is marked by its sophisticated gastronomy and its fashion history.

Paris is named the fashion capital, for a reason. The City of Lights, hosts the most prestigious high end fashion houses ever created. 
Among them, has a particular place in my heart : maison Chanel.

The historical house was created in Paris, by Gabrielle "Coco" Chasnel. Though her first clothing boutique was opened in Deauville in 1913.

Gabrielle Chanel eponymous haute house, was actually born out of an equestrian love triangle, she had an affair with two separate passionate high-born polo players, Etienne Bastian et Arthur "Boy" Capel. 
The two men had simultaneously helped her financing her fashion project, and ultimately helped her opening the famous store, in Rue Cambon 21st in Paris. 
Back with the hats 😃, la mademoiselle got highly drawn into the equestrian universe, when she lived with Etienne Bastan at the Château de Royallieu, horsebackriding with him in the estate. 
She designed a whole line for women inspired with polo attires, she observed her boyfriend wearing. Etienne Bastian left the first floor of his parisian appartment on Boulevard Malesherbes, to her fiance so she could estalish her very first shop. 
For legal reason that small shop was reserved for hats sales only. These hats were highly inspired with the equestrian helmets.


 "The Boy" is the notorious clutch quilted bag named after the founder's name lover Boy Capel.
• perfumes : Chanel n°5 created in 1921 is a worldwide bestseller. Gabrielle Chanel intended to encapsulate "un parfum de femme à odeur de femme". It embodies perfectly how I envision feminity. 
The Famously quoted by Marilyn Monroe during a Life magazine interview in 1952: -"Marilyn, what do you wear to bed ? So I said I only wear Chanel N°5". 
That perfume has ever since been associated with the most beauriful and unapolagetically sensual woman alive. 


We cannot evoke maison Chanel without talking about its signature centrepiece: the tweed suit. That emblematic two-piece set had been introduced in 1925.
The Chanel suit was worn by influential and fashionable women such as Princess Diana, Jackie Kennedy. 
Inspired by sportswear, the iconic course tweed fabric used in the detailed crafting of Chanel suits was initially not considered a glamorous textile. Tweed was primarily manufactured in Scottish twill mills, where Chanel discovered the true diversity of the fabric. 
Chanel’s passion for feminizing tweed by implementing new colors, materials, and textures to the then-underutilized fabric took the fashion world by storm, inspiring other French couturiers to employ her methods. 
The slim skirt and collarless jacket dubbed “Chanel’s uniform” became widely known with the help of press coverage, specifically a magazine image of actress Ina Claire dressed in a Chanel suit printed in 1924.

The high-end contemporary brand is a global reference in the luxury world, it embodies and represents liberated and independant working women, with a tomboy haircut, "coupe à la garçonne".
Chanel possesses an unique savoir-faire, that makes its fashion collections recognizibles among others fashion design houses. The clothing line is indeed famous, but
The house has proven its prestigious reputation by introducing timeless, collector signature creations.
 

Karl Lagerfeld 
The German-born Karl Lagerfeld was appointed creative director in 1983, few years after Gabrielle Chanel passed away.  
Lagerfeld assumed the role with respect for the traditions of the house, retaining several items and methods intrinsic to the brand’s identity. His vision aligned with the Chanel’s DNA, to propel the brand towards avant-garde fashion. 
The avant-gardist Lagerfeld vision, translates into transforming the conservative pink pastel suits from the 50s to a modern dusted off 80ish two-piece set.
Lagerfeld  had contributed a lot inéto the timeless piece, all the while keeping in mind the power and popularity of Chanel’s original idea. 
As the result of a high price tag, Lagerfeld understood the mature appeal towards the suited style and aspired to rejuvenate the idea of the iconic item. He created suits from denim, punk-style tweed, and bright neon wool, paired with tweed bralettes and even some Chanel alpine skis.
 He did it little-by-little, noting at the time that, “Even if she never did it this way, it’s very Chanel, no?” Lagerfeld was an innovator, he tapped muses like Ines de la Fressanges and ’90s supermodels including Claudia Schiffer, Christy Turlington, Vanessa Paradis, and Linda Evangelista for campaigns and fashion shows, challenging the more conservative past of Chanel.


L’HISTOIRE D’UNE DES PLUS GRANDES MARQUES FRANÇAISES.
La marque Chanel est aujourd’hui une véritable référence en matière de mode et de luxe à travers le monde entier. Depuis les débuts de l'aventure en 1910, Chanel incarne la femme libre et indépendante. Les créations se veulent contemporaines pour répondre aux besoins des femmes mais aussi intemporelles, avec des classiques qui restent toute une vie dans la garde-robe. Au vu de son succès extraordinaire, la marque a travaillé avec le même savoir-faire incontournable les vêtements, les parfums, les bijoux et les chaussures. En parlant de ces dernières, un modèle s’est particulièrement détaché à travers le temps et les collections, c’est la ligne dénommée Slingback.

TOUT SAVOIR SUR LA CÉLÈBRE CHAUSSURE SLINGBACK AUX DIFFÉRENTES FORMES.
Durant son histoire, Chanel a mis au point différents modèles de chaussures mais la gamme Slingback est sans aucun doute celle qui a obtenu le plus les faveurs du public féminin. Cette mythique chaussure bicolore a vu le jour en 1957. À l’origine, cette dernière était représentée sous la forme d’un escarpin à bride avec un talon carré de 5 cm. Depuis toujours, elle permet à la femme d’avoir une entière liberté de mouvement. L’aspect bicolore illustre la valeur forte du modèle puisque les chaussures de l’époque étaient la plupart du temps monochromes et classiques. Effectivement, le soulier est beige en sa base et une pointe de noir vient lui apporter sa touche finale. Des personnalités célèbres de l’époque comme Brigitte Bardot ou Catherine Deneuve l’adoptent immédiatement. Cependant, Chanel ne reste pas sur ses acquis et revisite le modèle à chaque saison, 
à travers différentes versions, de la sandale aux derbies en passant par les escarpins.
