# My art

I love clothes, shoes, accessories According to seasons, moods, social settings, I will assemble pieces together, so the final outcome
may be ehthereal and spectacular. As long as I feel good about myself and my body, I do not have any fear to spark reactions or get attention. I dress for myself and to express through my outfits.

As painters use canvas, music composers use notebooks, graphic designers their graphic tablets, me a fashionista will collect my favourite pieces and put them together during events, ceremonies, dinners.

## Fashion Vita

Having a creative soul in fashion, is having to think through how to match colours, fabrics, motifs, the geometrical shapes, then also check the weather, the seasons. Being up to date with the latest trends. 

I love to draw, and imagine which dress will I wear for a special event and which heels will coordinate the outfit, haircut, jeweleries, and which bag will wrap the outcome.


Fashion is just my vibe. I am not afraid to express that side of myself, by dressing sexy and boldly. You cannot predict how I will dress the next day. 

Weather and trends are indeed choosing components, but I pick my clothes also according to my moods at the time. 

One day I can dress very girly very pinky and the other, I go out in the absolute tom boyish way: XXL punk rock t-shirt design  with a punk, with a torn-up boyfriend jean, and Dr. Martens.

I just go with how my mind flows at the moment. My fashion moods are mostly intertiwned with the various musical inspirations I had growing up: 

My music tastes are ecclectic and contain a wide range of various music genres.

From Mary J. Blige, passing by Radiohead and the Cure. Music as fashion possess a place has grand in my life.

Intertwine them two, to draw clothes pieces, go shopping, and getting an outfit to go outside, is also taking its inspiration through the musical bands
I am listening to, their universes, the genre where they belong.

For example,

- the Goth fashion: I always been drawn by that universe, with their maximalist makeups and hairstyles. Their metallic huge platforms boots with, worn with extra large black pants and chains. As a huge fan of The cure band and their melancholic sounds,
 had given me many ideas through the years, to dress.
