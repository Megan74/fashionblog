-- record scratch --  Let's go back in time üòÄ

Back in the day in the 70s, cocaine was that recreative, fun and go-to drug, that was mainly consumed during parties. The disco era with its overpacked dancefloors, filled with energized acrobatic and fashionable dancers not leaving until dawn, 
and with its sparkly roller rinks, with a glitter ball suspended to the roof with music blasting on hundreds of decibels, was actually the visual symbolism of how coke was used at the time. 
Visually and socially, using cocaine was acceptable and COOL. That image got fastly tainted a few years later, when coke was linked with negative connotations, and when it had drastically decimated whole communities.

Crack cocaine is a free base form of cocaine, mixed with baking soda. Contrarily of coke, that drug is smoked through a pot, and not sniffed through the nostrils. Its free base property, brings to its user THAT indescribable and instantaneous pleasure. 
The crack cocaine downside, is evidently the addiction fastness, that occured IMMEDIATELY after the first inhalation. It literally only takes one use, to become an addict for the rest of your life. 
The era when using coke was hip, is definately over. Crack cocaine took over as soon as it hit the american streets. That new drug, BULLDOZED the society on a high scale.

What also differentiate the coke with crack cocaine, is the target customer: coke is mainly used by the elites, the yuppies, the beautiful fashion models, the show business world. On the other hands, crack is mainly used by the poorest communities, the most vulnerabe ones, as its price is very affordable. 
Hence, the underprivileged portion of the American society, was sadly the first one hit by the "crack epidemy", and its cataclysmic and irreparable repercussions, that it has ensued. 
The devastating crack addiction consequences, had forced the President Reagan to intervene, and launched a political offensive against that new plague. Yet, his "war on drugs" had not met the population‚Äôs expectations, the drug plague had worsened, as none of his measures were adequate enough to contain it. 
His brutal politics got worse, because instead of providing an appropriate care system and assistance infrasctructures to rehabilitate the drug addicts, his politics purposely antagonized, demonized and criminalized a whole social group.

That group that the Reagan administration had in aim, you have perfectly guessed, was the Black community (BC).
The crack epidemy PLUS on top of that the anti-drug war, launched by the government, scourged from near and far the community in its entirety. Families were decimated, either with overdose deaths, extremely severe and unjust jail sentences or gang assassinations.
Thousands of children, have lost relatives, parents due to that plague. Some of these new orphans have been placed by the Child Protective Services (CPS), to selectively picked families, (foster care), until their hit the age majority.
That system ended up been a huge failure, as a consequence of major federal funding cuts and rigid systemic racism, that had for mission to purposefully neglect specific communities.
The child welfare system firstly initiated on the sole purpose to protect these newly placed kids, was sadly conducted <a href="https://imprintnews.org/child-welfare-2/nearly-half-of-children-experience-cps-investigations/57396 "> more violence </a> to them. Physical and sexual abuses inflicted to foster kids, were frequently reported to the authorities, that ignore them at the time, by not even conducting further investigations..
These orphan children who have already seen horrors and unspeakable tragedies throughout their early lives, had to endure furthermore abuse from their new caretakers, with questionable motives, who at the end, have surely signed up to collect their federal cheques. 

After they hit the majority, these kids were then thrown out off that failed system, without any social safety net nor a proper reinsertion structure. Most of them had not even finished high school, nor having the possibility to access to a higher education system to get a valuable degree, that would safely equip them to face the society's challenges, and secure a good future.
Sadly, many of them ended up affiliated to street gangs to create a sense of belongingness (my fingers sprained while writting that ugly world), and some of them have developed severe post-traumatic stress disorders due to years of abuse and neglect, and had to mentally cope with drug and alcohol that unavoidably led them to severe addictions. 
Tragically, some of them have ended up in jail or have passed away, with either one of the reasons precedingly mentioned above. 


Instead of strengthening the government institutions to protect them from any corruption attempts. Instead of helping the youth living in these vulnerable areas, directly exposed to violence, poverty, drug trafficking, by funding educational public services aimed to facilitate them to access to higher education systems.
Instead of going at the drug problem's source itself, which is poverty, and creating effective ressources to reduce the income inequalities, the US government had treated the crack epidemy, in an uneccessary and repressive way, by funding billions of dollars on law enforcements and extremely punitive measures, at the BC expense.
The political agenda held by the Reagan administration and its Republican minions at the Congress, was only to stay in power, nothing more. The drug problem was factually not discriminating, it has demolished families and communities across the whole country, most particularly the poorest part of America.
Indeed, the Native Americans, Latino communities, White communities living in low-income rural areas, were also devastated by the drug addiction problem.
So the agenda was clear: target only one social category, the one that was historically owned as property and treated as such, the one that is the most hated and resented. 
Targeting them by amplifying the voters emotions and reactions through media propaganda, so they can rally up and quickly vote for the toughest legislations to "fix" the issue. Targeting them through the media, press, radio, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQXgVM30mIY"> TV ads </a>, 
with dog whistle messages, that cognitively intensifies already ingrained negative stereotypes against black people.¬†
The Reagan administration got all the ammunitions to bully and harass the BC, with brutal law enforcement, while the drug problem was firstly a national issue.

THAT all above, is the political context, where the Hip Hop Rap culture had popped up. These DISMAL circumstances give you relief (a pretty graphic one), and a better understanding, on how one of the most impactful artistic movement was formed. As punk rock, hip-hop was born in the 70s, in the Bronx, a rough area in New-York. As punk rock, hip-hop has emerged through anger, systemic violence, and injustice. 
Indeed, rap music is artistically evoking, every difficult themes the BC is facing on the daily basis. Philadelphia, NYC, Baltimore, the West Coast, and the Southern part of the US, felt an immediate connection with that new art, and created later on as well on their sides, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1079761477/snoop-dogg-now-owns-death-row-records"> their own hip-hop divisions </a>.   
The hip-hop culture rapidly became a global trend, an expressive alternative to deal with gang violence, police brutality, the crack plague devastating families, unfair & unbalanced justice system that bullies poor and/or Afro-Americans citizens. All the suffering was put into rhyming speeches, going with an unique melody mixed with 70s sampled music tracks, and purposefully scrapped sounds made by DJs on turntables.
Hip-Hop music is also about the art of freestyling: spewing rhyming words as a form of poetry right out of your mouth, words that came right out of your mind without any rehearsals or previous writings, AND on top of that make them rhyme them onto a specific cadence, is TRUE and RAW talent. 
The East Coast vs West Coast war led by the two lengendary nemesis, Biggie and Tupac, gave us the MOST provocative, brutal, and insightful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU"> freestyles EVER </a>. 
At that time the two coasts rap war, felt like a cultural earthquake ü§Ø. 

Hip-Hop is soooooooooooooooooo vast culturally speaking, that it even possesses a subculture (that I will sadly go through partly, otherwise that post will never see the light of the day, as there is so much to talk about): beatboxing, break dancing, graffiti art in street walls, rap slang/AAVE languages, fashion styles. 

African-American Vernacular English¬†(AAVE) is an American dialect used by the BC. It has been created and used by the slaves that worked in cotton and sugar plantations, to resist to cultural assimilation and maintain a distinct cultural identity. AAVE is still in use by the BC today, it is characterized with a mix of Caribbean creole languages, 
a mix of purposely altered vocabulary/grammar/conjugation, purposeful word-switch in sentences (‚Äúwhere you AT?‚Äù), and a recognizable accent and syllable intonations. 
AAVE is so influential that the biggest advertisement companies get to use them to launch their multi-million dollars global marketing campaigns. AAVE even had its own <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=urbandictionary"> website</a>, where every term is explained and put into context (used mostly by adults to stay trendy üòÇ). 
‚ÄúSalty‚Äù, ‚Äúwoke‚Äù, ‚Äúbae‚Äù, ‚Äúshook‚Äù, ‚Äúcrib‚Äù, "cool‚Äù, come all from AAVE. Hip hop artists, are also using that dialect on the daily basis. As they are writers and creators themselves, it became natural for them to invent and implement brand new words, and new meanings into the AAVE language: ‚Äúgoon‚Äù, ‚Äúbeef‚Äù, ‚Äúsnitch‚Äù, ‚Äúchill‚Äù, ‚Äúcrew‚Äù, ‚Äúfresh‚Äù, ‚Äúvibe‚Äù, ‚Äúfeds‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äù, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs break it down‚Äù.

The hip-hop culture massively influenced the fashion world as we know it today. Firstly viewed as violent gang members, criminals and murderers, hip-hop artists are finally recognized by their other creative peers. 
They are even collaborating with each others: Run DMC, a 80s rap group from Queens, NYC, was the first hiphop group to sign a deal with a clothing brand. Their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNua1lFDuDI"> "My Adidas"</a>, has influenced a whole generation. That song has pushed its audience to buy adidas sneakers, so everytime they were playing that song at their live concerts, the public got to remove their brand new Adidas sneakers, 
to wave them in the air as they sang along with the mythic rap group. 
The cultural impact was so huge, that the Adidas brand saw a marketing opportunity to partner with the legendary group, with a 1 million dollar contract deal. 
Louis Vuitton a historical french haute-couture house, has partnered with Kanye West in 2009. They jointly launched a pair of sneakers named the Jasper sneakers.
Fashion is a huge component in the culture: saggy pants, durags, cap worn upside down, bucket hat, velvet tracksuit ensemble and of course SNEAKERS. 
Sneakers were at first exclusively worn by basketball players before the 70s. But then during 70s-80s era, the trends had shifted: the ‚ÄúChucks‚Äù, the Adidas superstars, the Nike Cortez, were all worn by rappers like Run DMC (of course), LL Cool J, and famously worn by passionate street break dancers. 
Jewelleries necklaces, rings, sneakers, hats, are as important as the outfit itself. The Hiphop aesthetic is highlighted by wealth, by the art of "showing off". The richer the artist is, more billions of carats diamond necklaces, diamond rings, golden, silver, diamond grillz 
he will wear. $$bling blinggg$$

Hiphop is an artistic movement I proudly grew up with. A culture that has demonstrated my younger self, that unexpected and phenomenal gems can grow out from pain, from sorrow, from grief.
Ever since the anti-drug war in the 70s, the already fragile BC, that had freshly received Civil Rights legal shield in the 60s, that were progressively emancipating from slavery ever since 1865, had to go through newer challenges
thrown by power structures. The Reaganism has DESTROYED the BC to its core: the family structure. The repercussions from his political actions commited 50 years ago, are ABYSMAL and can still be perceived until today. The generational wealth gap between White people and Black people, is just mindblowing.
When the core of a community has been disparaged, how to move forward? How to move forward when a whole community is suffering as a whole entity from untreated, undiagnosed and unhealed trauma, caused by decades and decades of systemic mistreatments. How to move forward when the father figure, the "chief cornerstone", that is supposed to lead, that is supposed to inspirs, that is supposed to guide the next generations, had been taken away from their children, by a brutal and antagonizing system?
How to move forward when a "social system" purposely maintains a whole community into poverty (by neglecting them and not even try to fund strong educational systems in rough areas), hence => unavoidably leads to crime, violence, drugs, jail, deaths? 
How many yearrssss will it take to rebuild the community foundation, and move on from its despicable past? 

Art though.. Art is thee tool that Black people all over the world, has always used to move Forward, has always used to go Through, has always used to Power through, to Fight, to Resist, to Real, to Ascend.‚ú®
Art has managed to build up, what was purposely dismantled by power structures and systemic racism. Art had made the BC's life more tolerable for centuries: The Blues music was created by the Slaves, when they were singing while picking cottons mistreatd by their masters all day long, under humid and extreme hot weather, in the Mississipi plantations in the 1800s ; Hiphop was created by young Black men, who had no grew up with a proper family support, nor functional family structure, without having a strong father figure, 
who mainly came from unloved and abusive foster cares, who had seen family members, friends been taken away by drugs, police or gang violence. 

Art is the way through.. ‚ù§Ô∏è
