France Food Fashion  🇫🇷🇫🇷

The french international reach is marked by its sophisticated gastronomy and its fashion history.

Paris is named the fashion capital, for a reason. The City of Lights, hosts the most prestigious high end fashion houses ever created. 
Among them, has a particular place in my heart : maison Chanel.

The historical house was created in Paris, by Gabrielle "Coco" Chasnel. Though her first boutique was opened in Deauville in 1913, 
As World wars occured, Coco Chanel development activities was pretty difiicult, though she managed to opened a store in Biarritz and few years later in Paris.
The Chanel founder, was not only famous her clothing line, but also thanks to perfume she had launched in 1921, "Chanel n°5". That is one of world perfume bestseller.

We cannot evoke maison Chanel without talking about its signature centrepiece: the tweed suit. That emblematic two-piece set had been introduced in 1925.
The Chanel suit was worn by influential and fashionable women such as Princess Diana, Jackie Kennedy. 
Inspired by sportswear, the iconic course tweed fabric used in the detailed crafting of Chanel suits was initially not considered a glamorous textile. Tweed was primarily manufactured in Scottish twill mills, where Chanel discovered the true diversity of the fabric. 
Chanel’s passion for feminizing tweed by implementing new colors, materials, and textures to the then-underutilized fabric took the fashion world by storm, inspiring other French couturiers to employ her methods. 
The slim skirt and collarless jacket dubbed “Chanel’s uniform” became widely known with the help of press coverage, specifically a magazine image of actress Ina Claire dressed in a Chanel suit printed in 1924.
