**record scratch** Let's go back in time üòÄ

Back in the day in the 70s, cocaine was that recreative, fun and go-to drug that was consumed during parties: the disco era with its overpacked dancefloors filled with energized acrobatic and fashionable dancers not leaving until dawn, and its sparkly roller rinks with a glitter ball suspended to the roof,
 with music blasting on hundreds of decibels, was actually the visual symbolism of how coke was used at the time. 
Visually, socially cocaine was acceptable and COOL. That image got fastly tainted a few years later, when coke was linked with negative connotations and had drastically decimate whole communities.

Crack cocaine, is a free base form of cocaine mixed with baking soda. Contrarily of coke, that drug is smoked through a pot, and not sniffed through the nostrils. Its free base property, brings to its user THAT indescribable and instantaneous pleasure. 
The crack cocaine downside : is evidently, the addiction fastness, that occured RIGHT after the first inhalation, it only takes one use to become an addict for the rest of your life. 

The era when using coke was hip is definately over, crack cocaine took over as soon as it hit the american streets. That new drug, BULLDOZED the society on the high scale.

What also differentiate the coke with crack cocaine, is also is targeted consumers: the first one is mainly used by the elites, the yuppies, the show business world. The second one on the other hands, is mainly used by the poorest communities, the most vulnerabe ones, as its price is very affordable. 
Hence, the underprivileged portion of the American society, were the first hit by the "crack epidemy" and its cataclysmic and irreparable repercussions, that it has ensued. 
President Reagan, had to intervene and launch a political offensive against that new plague. Yet, his "war on drugs" had not met the population‚Äôs expectations, the drug plague had worsened, with no adequate measures to contain it. 
His brutal politic got worse because instead of providing an appropriate care system and assistance infrasctructures to rehabilitate, the drug addicts, his politics had purposely antagonized, demonized and criminalized a whole social group.
That group that the Reagan administration had in aim, you have perfectly guessed, was the Black community (BC).
The crack epidemy PLUS the anti-war drugs launched by the government, scourged from near and far that community in its entirety. Families were decimated, either with overdose deaths, extremely severe and unjust jail sentences, gang assassinations, and so on and so far.

Thousands of children, have lost relatives, parents due to that plague. Some of these new orphans have been placed by the Child Protective Services (CPS), to selectively picked families, foster care, until their hit the majority.
That system ended up been a huge failure, as a consequence of major federal funding cuts and a rigid systemic racism at the time, that purposefully neglect specific communities.
The child welfare system firstly initiated on the sole purpose to protect these newly placed kids, was sadly conducted <a href="https://imprintnews.org/child-welfare-2/nearly-half-of-children-experience-cps-investigations/57396 "> more violence </a>, physical and sexual abuses inflicted to foster kids, were frequently reported to the authorities.
These orphan children who have already seen horrors and unspeakable tragedies throughout their early lives, had to endure furthermore abuse from their new caretakers, with questionable motives, who at the end, have surely signed up to collect their federal cheques. 
After they hit the majority, these kids were then thrown out off that failed system, without any social safety net nor a proper reinsertion structure. Most of them had not even finished high school, nor having the possibility to access to a higher and valuable educational degree, that would safely equip them to face the society's challenges, and secure a good future.
Sadly, many of them ended up affiliated to street gangs to create a sense of belongingness (my fingers sprained while writting that ugly world), some of them have developed severe post-traumatic stress disorder, due to years of abuse and neglect, and had to mentally cope with drug and alcohol, that unavoidably led them to severe addictions. 
And tragically, some of them have ended up in jail or passed away, with either one of the reasons precedingly mentioned before. 


Instead of strengthening the government institutions to protect them from any corruption attempts. Instead of helping the youth living in these vulnerable areas, directly exposed to violence, poverty, drug trafficking, by funding educational public services aimed to facilitate them to access to higher education systems.
Instead of going at the drug problem's source itself, which is poverty and creating effective ressources to reduce the income inequalities, the US government had treated the crack epidemic in an uneccesserary repressive way, by funding billions of dollars on law enforcements and extremely punitive measures, at the extent of BC.
The political agenda held by the Reagan administration, and its republican minions in the Congress, was only to stay in power, nothing else. The drug problem was not discriminating, it has demolished families and communities across the whole country, most particularly the poorest part of America.
the Native Americans, Latino communities, White communities living in low-income rural areas, were also devastated by the drug addiction problem.

So the agenda was clear: target only one category, the one that was historically owned as property and treated as such, the one that is the most hated and resented. 
Target the most feared one, by amplifying these emotions and reactions to the voters, through media, press, radio, TV ads [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQXgVM30mIY ], with dog whistle messages, that cognitively intensifies the already ingrained negative stereotypes against black people.¬†The Reagan administration got all the ammunitions to bully and harass the black communities, with brutal law enforcement, while the drug problem was a national issue.

THAT is the political context, where the Hip Hop Rap culture popped up. These tragic circumstances give you relief and a better understanding of how one the most impactful artistic movement has erected. As punk rock, hip-hop was born in the 70s in the Bronx, a rough area in New-York. That movement emerged through pain, violence, and injustice. 

Indeed, rap music is artistically evoking, every difficult theme, BC faces on the daily basis. Philadelphia, NYC, Baltimore, the West Coast, and the Southern part of US, felt an immediate connection with that new art, and had created later on as well on their sides, in their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1079761477/snoop-dogg-now-owns-death-row-records"> own zone areas </a>.    

The hip-hop culture rapidly became a global trend, an expressive alternative to deal with gang violence, police brutality, the crack plague devastating families, unfair & unbalanced legal treatment when poor and afro Americans. All the suffering was put into rhyming speeches going with a melody, gave inspiration to DJs scrapping with turntables and mixing 70s sampled music tracks at their own sauce, created the most provocative, brutal, and insightful freestyles ever [https://www.xxlmag.com/best-hip-hop-radio-freestyles/]. Hip-Hop is soooooooooooooooooo vast culturally speaking, that it even possesses a subculture that I‚Äôll sadly go through partly: beatboxing, break dancing, graffiti art in the streets wall, rap slang/AAVE languages, fashion styles. 

African-American Vernacular English¬†(AAVE) is an American dialect used by the BC, it has started be used from the slaves in plantations until now. AAVE is characterized with a mix with of Caribbean creole languages, a mix of purposely altered vocabulary/grammar/conjugation, a mix  of purposeful words switch in sentences (‚Äúwhere you AT?‚Äù), and a recognizable accent and syllable intonations. AAVE is so influential that the biggest advertisement companies get to use them, to launch global multi-million dollars marketing campaigns. AAVE even had its own website, where every term is explained and put into context (used mostly by adults to stay trendy I would say xD). 
‚ÄúSalty‚Äù, ‚Äúwoke‚Äù, ‚Äúbae‚Äù, ‚Äúshook‚Äù, ‚Äúcrib‚Äù, 2cool‚Äù, come from AAVE. Hip hop artists, are using on the daily basis that dialect, as writers it became natural for them to implement and invent new words and new meanings, as a unifying social system. ‚ÄúGoon‚Äù, ‚Äúbeef‚Äù, ‚Äúsnitch‚Äù, ‚Äúchill‚Äù, ‚Äúcrew‚Äù, ‚Äúfresh‚Äù, ‚Äúvibe‚Äù, ‚Äúfeds‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äù, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs break it down‚Äù.

Fashion wise today, the hip-hop influence is still massively talked about, many draw big inspirations from it, first viewed as violent gang members, criminals and killers, hip-hop artists are now collaborating with historical fashion designer houses now. Indeed, RUN DMC  80s rap group from Queens, NYC,  influenced a whole generation with their music,      . Louis Vuitton partnered with Kanye West in 2009, and launched a pair of sneakers named Jasper sneaker [ https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/_Louis-Vuitton-x-Kanye-West-Jasper-Patchwork-or-Size-6.5  ]. Kanye was not a pioneer in the fashion partnership landscape. Fashion is a huge component in the culture, saggy pants, durags, cap worn upside down, bob hat, tracksuits ensemble and of course SNEAKERS. 
Sneakers were at first exclusively worn by basketball players. During the 70s-80s era, as Hip-Hop made its first appearance, the ‚ÄúChucks‚Äù, the Adidas superstars, the Nike Cortez, were all worn by superstars like Run DMC rap members,  LL Cool J, and famously worn by any the break dancers. 

oyant l‚Äôampleur du ph√©nom√®ne, la marque aux trois bandes signe dans la foul√©e un contrat avec RUN DMC dont le montant s‚Äô√©l√®ve √† 1 million de dollars. Cet¬†endorsement deal¬†va ouvrir la voie √† d‚Äôautres partenariats avec plusieurs artistes dans le futur √† l‚Äôinstar de Kanye West, Pharrell Williams ou bien Beyonc√©.
