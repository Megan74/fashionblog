The Catholic Church was at in the Medieval era, the most powerful institution in the European continent. The Pope, head of the Church had so much power that he could change and institute rules that would change the life trajectory of millions civilians. Pope Gregory Xlll as example, switched the entire calendar in 1512 with the help of mathematicians and astronomers, in order to revoke the previous Caesar calendar. 
The introduction of the Gregorian calendar was essential so the 24 hours would equal the day time measure. 
The main goal here was to stay perfectly in sync with the solar cycle. The Church’s impact has still a tremendous influence in our today’s life for good and BAD (slavery, patriarchy, proselytism, Natives Americans, Jews, Africans, Aborigines genocides).
 The medieval society was ruled by two entities:

 -The Noble class: Monarchs, Kings, the Emperors.

 -The Roman Catholic Church, the Pope, the archbishops. 

These two power structures went hand in hand to implement their self-serving policies in European societies and across the Globe. 

The Age of Discovery, is a historical period that occurred between the 15th century to the 17th century in European history. That essential era retraces the Europeans seafaring, missions based upon exploring and colonising regions across the Globe. The age of discovery is also a period when many major scientific breakthroughs occurred. 
Explorers and scientists shifted many paradigms that were previously reinforced/backed up by the Catholic Church as the time, such as geocentrism: a belief that the Sun and the other planets from the same astronomical system spin around ours.
 Science also managed through thorough researches to challenge beliefs that the Earth is flat. Scientists indeed, went out of their ways to debunk approaches validated by the RCC, and by extension defy the Church authority. Marco Polo, Magellan and many others, transformed these controversial theories into practical experiments. 
 The Earth being round was first supported by Greeks thinkers such as Aristotle, before the seafaring actually took place. In the European lens/perspective, the Age of discovery put lights on parts of the Worlds, ecosystems, cultures, ethnies, that were billions of miles away different from theirs: the immense African continent with its several tribes and ethnies, Asia, South-Asia, the Americas, Caribbean islands, Australia. 
The Roman catholic Church (RCC) and the Noble rulers, saw in the “New Worlds” discoveries an excellent opportunity to make an abundant amount of money in zones that overflow rare ressources that cannot be found in the old continent. Not only they found a an opportunity to create brand new economies with a beyond-border market that will generate a lot of revenue, but they also found the perfect opportunity  to expand their power through the mechanism of that brand new economical system in process on a global scale.
But how did they to impose a system that functions on ruling and exploiting whole sovereign nations that live with their own laws, customs, languages, beliefs, diet habits, etc. ?
With religion. The Spanish inquisition initiated by the RCC, was a powerful office that tried the heretics (non-Christians civilians) by imprisoning them, exiled them, torturing them, forcing them to convert into Christianity, and confiscating their properties. These methods were firstly put in place to eradicate the Jews and Muslims from benefiting of the soon-to-be most influential and impactful economical trade the History has ever known: The Triangular trade. 
That transatlantic trade was crucial to maintain and increase wealth in Europeans countries. The purpose was to export non-essential commodities from a specific region to another World zone where it was more needed, creating a supply-demand system on a global scale, and offsetting trade imbalances between the different regions participating in that economy.
The RCC inquisition was also an ammunition to legitimise slavery and the persecution of Native Americans on their own sole. The Church relied on biblical scriptures to justify the servitude of human beings, and their erasure through violence. In the bible dark skin tones were associated with evilness and bestiality. 
 In the inquisition office, disturbing statements rapidly erupted, statements entered around ideologies that the African population does not own a soul, that they are worse than beasts and products of evilness, and that their only way to not end up in hell was to be converted into Christianity.
The <a href=" http://blog.ac-versailles.fr/zizaniemichelet/public/lumieres/l__esprit_des_lois_-_Copie.pdf"> political philosopher Montesquieu retraced perfectly the anti-African mindset </a> and naturally legitimised the subjugations and erasure of these targeted demographics, that were purposely turnt into property and capital goods. Montesquieu, and many other modern era thinkers, philosophers, politicians, saw in the slavery trade an economical requirement to generate revenue. 
 The religion justified these practices because according to its holy scriptures, the subjugated population were not persons, they did not own a soul.


The transatlantic trade mechanism: 

 - In Europe: exportation of commodities in Africa  => pots, pans, guns, alcohol, horses / importation of commodities from the new World : sugar, cotton, rum, tobacco, coffee from 
 - In the Americas and Islands: exportation off commodities from Africa: essentially the Slaves being shipped for cultivating the exporting products to Europe in exchange of imported goods by European merchants.

The Slave mercantile capital system started in the 15th century. It firstly involved Portugal and Spain, and rapidly being followed by Britain, France and Netherlands. Indeed, Spanish traders took the first African slaves to America in 1503. The next centuries the slave trade developed a lucrative commercial system that developed whole new economies through the mass transportations of human beings and their subjugation into capital goods. 
The transatlantic slave trade transported millions of Africans from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-23078662"> West Africa </a> to the Caribbean’s islands and the Americas for centuries, destroying along whole nations, cultures, and their History.
Before the Europeans ambitions came into fruition, the African continent had a beautiful, inspiring, culturally rich History. Before the colonial period in central Africa the most damaged area from slavery trade, the Kongo kingdom nations possessed a unique language: Kikongo, specific rituals, their own social rules and laws, and ethnics: the Bantou. The empire covered the today Angola, DRC-Kinshasa and RdCongo-Brazzaville. In 1483 when the Portuguese Navigators                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     arrived for the first time in the Kongo shores in quest of political and commercial alliances, the kingdom was already a powerful and centralised state. A well established sovereign nation that highly impressed its freshly accosted Europeans visitors. Few years later, the Milanese Ambassador stated in Lisbon, that Mbanza Kongo https://www.britannica.com/place/Mbanza-Congo the kingdom’s capital reminded him of Evora, a prestigious city which was the royal residence in Portugal. 
The transatlantic slave trade has indeed decimated nations, spread unnamable atrocities from West Africa to the “New World”. But along these monstrosities in the name of capitalism and supremacist ambitions, whole cultures  managed to emerge from that dark era. The 10 million of Africans who had been shipped as Slaves to these new places took with them their soul. The African soul that was at the time completely disproven by “great thinkers”, by the European monarchs and the Catholic Church, was the source of the most beautiful pieces of art never created.
Through adversity, pain, brutality, torture and their lifelong nightmare by being physically tortured, by seeing their relatives, families being killed, raped, their souls however have in an unexplainable way NEVER been broken. 

### DANCE: expression outlet, a coping mechanism

Dancing was THEE way for slaves to cope, to face the life long servitude penitence. Dancing was always being a powerful outlet for African culture. The captured slaves felt as well that this would be a way to resist from any assimilations and stay no matter what they went through, connected with their true roots, their true identity.  While that art form was considered by white people as vulgar and undignified, dancing managed nonetheless to link the African slaves and Afro-descendants to their African heritage.
 Dancing seemed to be an artistic expression that was way stronger than any other aspect of the African culture. 
Indeed, that outlet has a substantial importance in Africa as a continent: not only it was (still is) a routine communal activity, but also an integral part of ceremonies that bind groups together as people. It links one’s personal identity to a group. 
Dancing connect people to events throughout the life cycle. The individual and the community are commemorated in dance: fertility dances and rite-of-passage dances, are symbolically celebrated with art of body movements and that even before the slave mercantile. Like all social institutions, black dance arenas reflect the history, sociocultural tenor, and power relations of their era.
The <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/oped/comment/rumba-is-the-history-of-slavery-it-went-to-america-and-came-back-3656872"> rumba dance </a> taking its inspiration from bantou african ethnics' rhythm and roots. That new dance was formed in Cuba a Spanish colony at the time, as a protest, form of rebellion, a vital outlet of self-expression for people denied freedoms. That upbeat and recognisable tempo, emphasised by energetic rythms and the beat of hollow claves and African drum, was meant to dance sensually through hips and ass moves. 
Rumba is a sensual and seduction ritual, that also spiritually helps the fertility activation. 
Rumba “It’s an expression of the joy of life, created during the slavery period in the sugar plantations, in the neighbourhoods, in the ports, on the railway lines,” said Miguel Barnet, president of Cuba’s writers and artists guild. “Wherever the slave worked, he needed his spiritual and liturgical songs, for salvation and healing.”
In the same spirit as the rumba dance in Cuba, <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/oped/comment/rumba-is-the-history-of-slavery-it-went-to-america-and-came-back-3656872"> the Champeta dance </a> born in Colombia a former Spanish colony, was a lively musical rhythm, a new genre created by the slaves mainly originated from Kongo, who managed to free themselves from their masters during the 18th century, and who to this day live in the town of San Basilio de Palenque. These noticeable African rhythms with percussions, were mixed with urban music that create the Champeta music genre, sung and danced until today in Cartagena. 


### MUSIC: negros spiritual, blues, gospel


It is said that blues originated on southern plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana in the 19th century. The founders were slaves, ex-slaves, and descendants of slaves. That whole new music genre came from Africa. Negro spiritual and gospel, are chants, work songs, drums, solos, and also dance. There are crossovers from blues to jazz and jazz to blues, and jazz and blues to gospel and gospel to jazz and blues. 
Blues music mainly emerged through suffering and resistance. Indeed, Slaves communicated secret messages through spirituals as a way to bypass the slave masters who would be listening in on their conversations. They sang through coded songs to provide instructions that would allow them to escape to the North and to freedom, particularly <a href="http://www.harriet-tubman.org/underground-railroad-secret-codes/"> on the Underground Railroad. </a> 
Sandra Jean Graham is an Associate Professor of Ethnomusicology at Babson College,  stated :  « Although slaves came from many different African societies, there were some common musical traditions that brought about the spiritual » .

### Other cultural heritage: Kikongo language in Brazil, Colombia, DR -  festivals, carnivals

Slavery brought African cultures to the new World, and also heritage such as languages. The Kongo empire main language was Kikongo, most of the population spoke that language before the transatlantic trade. When African slaves were transported to these colonial areas in Americas and Caribbean islands, the Kikongo was transported along, transmitted through slaves and afro-descendants until today. The Kikongo is still spoken in Brazilian, Colombian, Dominican, Cuban Panamian regions http://www.harriet-tubman.org/underground-railroad-secret-codes/, mixed with creole and Spanish, the kongo empire language remains spoken in post slavery areas.
 Today named « Habla Congo », the cultural heritage captured slaves took with them at the time, is now ingrained and taught to generations who directly descend from them. 
“African slaves never forgot about where they came from and passed along their memories to each subsequent generation through oral history and reminiscences” - Dwaine Plaza & Jane DeCosmo, “Women and the De-Africanisation of Trinidad Carnival: From the Jamette to Bikinis, Beads, and Feathers” . Carnivals are festivals of freedom performed in the face of European enslavement.
 The word “Carnival” etymologically comes in the pre-emancipation ritual of Cannes Brulees (sugarcane burning) that occurred on sugar plantations that enslaved millions of Africans in the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries.
 Here we explore the rich trove of historical sources that reveal acts of rebellion, music-making, dance, masking, and ritual at the origin of Carnival, in the southern of north America especially Louisiana state, the Caribbean islands and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in South America. 









One of the darkest times in history covered as a « genius » capitalist system that instituted the economic globalisation as we know it today, had created artistically and culturally speaking a new wave of expression outlets. 
Captured, treated as livestocks, tortured, brainwashed, used as “scientific” experimentations, all these horrific treatments would erase and silenced the Black community in the US, the islands and south/central Americas, but instead and miraculously out of ALL this misery that lasted CENTURIES, these poor people coming from different African empires and nations, speaking different languages, sharing different beliefs, rituals etc., found a way to stay in communion and help each other to go THROUGH these atrocities no matter what. No matter which unspeakable and disgusting acts the societies, the slave owners, the capitalist system perpetuated against them.
 They artistically ascended. ART was and still is today, the Black people’s lifeline and oxygen bottle, all around the world.
 Christianity, White supremacy, capitalism are in fact the true evil that crawled into the African soil, and ever since never let that continent in peace. The colour of our skin has never been questioned before Europeans entered our continent with supremacists’ ideologies backed up by religious rigmaroles, that questioned our humanity, questioned whether or not we were able to possess a soul. 
 As far as I am concerned, the soulless individuals are those who torn families apart, those who put them in chains, who transported them in ships for months long as vulgar disposable goods without any remorse and threw them in plantations, and force them to work all their lives until they bored enough to assassinate them.
  The questionnable Black souls changed the black and white, conservative, arbitrarily labelled societies, by sprinkling joyful, meaningful, deep, heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, mind-blowing pieces of art that the world needed.
