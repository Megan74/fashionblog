FFF : France Food Fashion  üá´üá∑üá´üá∑

The french international reach is marked by its sophisticated gastronomy and its influential fashion history.

Paris is named the fashion capital, for a reason. The City of Lights, hosts the most prestigious high end fashion houses ever created. 
Among them, one has a particular place in my heart : la Maison Chanel. The historical house was created in Paris, by Gabrielle "Coco" Chasnel. 
She opened her first official clothing boutique in Deauville in 1913.

# Equestrian & Love

Gabrielle Chanel eponymous haute house, was actually born out of an equestrian love triangle, she had an affair with two separate passionate high-born polo players, Etienne Bastian et Arthur "Boy" Capel. 
The two men had simultaneously helped her financing her fashion project, and ultimately helped her opening the infamous store, in Rue Cambon 21st in Paris. 
La mademoiselle got highly drawn into the equestrian universe, when she lived with Etienne Bastan at the Ch√¢teau de Royallieu, spending her free time horsebackriding with him in the estate. 
She designed a whole line for women inspired with polo attires, she observed her boyfriend wearing. Etienne Bastian left the first floor of his parisian appartment on Boulevard Malesherbes, to her fiance so she could estalish her very first shop. 
For legal reason that small shop was reserved for hats sales only. These hats were highly inspired with the equestrian helmets.

# Everlasting items 

The Chanel brand is today a true reference in terms of fashion and luxury throughout the world. Since the adventure began in 1910, Chanel has embodied the free and independent woman.
The creations are intended to be contemporary to meet the needs of women but also timeless,
 with classics that last a lifetime in the wardrobe.

 "The Boy" is the notorious clutch quilted bag named after the founder's name lover Boy Capel.
perfumes : Chanel n¬∞5 created in 1921 is a worldwide bestseller. Gabrielle Chanel intended to encapsulate "un parfum de femme √† odeur de femme". It embodies perfectly how I envision feminity. 
The Famously quoted by Marilyn Monroe during a Life magazine interview in 1952: -"Marilyn, what do you wear to bed ? So I said I only wear Chanel N¬∞5". 
That perfume has ever since been associated with the most beauriful and unapolagetically sensual woman alive. 


We cannot evoke maison Chanel without talking about its signature centrepiece: the tweed suit. That emblematic two-piece set had been introduced in 1925.
The Chanel suit was worn by influential and fashionable women such as Princess Diana, Jackie Kennedy. 
Inspired by sportswear, the iconic course tweed fabric used in the detailed crafting of Chanel suits was initially not considered a glamorous textile. Tweed was primarily manufactured in Scottish twill mills, where Chanel discovered the true diversity of the fabric. 
Chanel‚Äôs passion for feminizing tweed by implementing new colors, materials, and textures to the then-underutilized fabric took the fashion world by storm, inspiring other French couturiers to employ her methods. 
The slim skirt and collarless jacket dubbed ‚ÄúChanel‚Äôs uniform‚Äù became widely known with the help of press coverage, specifically a magazine image of actress Ina Claire dressed in a Chanel suit printed in 1924.


In terms of accessories one model has particularly stood out over time and collections, it is the line called Slingback.
ALL ABOUT THE FAMOUS SLINGBACK SHOE IN DIFFERENT SHAPES.
During its history, Chanel has developed different models of shoes, but the Slingback range is undoubtedly the one that has won the most favor with the female public.
This mythical two-tone shoe was born in 1957. Originally, the latter was represented in the form of a strappy pump with a 5 cm square heel. It has always allowed women complete freedom of movement.
The two-tone appearance illustrates the strong value of the model since the shoes of the time were mostly monochrome and classic. Indeed, the shoe is beige at its base and a touch of black adds its final touch.
Famous personalities of the time such as Brigitte Bardot or Catherine Deneuve adopted it immediately. However, Chanel does not rest on its achievements and revisits the  750$ model each season,
through different versions, from sandals to derbies and pumps.  

# Herr Lagerfeld 

The German-born Karl Lagerfeld was appointed creative director in 1983, few years after Gabrielle Chanel passed away.  
Considered a "near-dead brand", Lagerfeld took a risky bet by endorsing such an important position. The odds were yet against him at the time, but with his artistic ingenuity he had managed to revive the brand, and 
gave it a breath of fresh air.

Lagerfeld had perfectly assumed the role with respect for the traditions of the house. He kept several classic pieces, and maintained the old-fashioned methods used by Chanel herself, that are so intrinsic to the brand‚Äôs identity. His vision aligned with the Chanel founder's goal: to propel the brand towards avant-garde fashion. 
The avant-gardist Lagerfeld vision, has translated into transforming the conservative pink pastel suits from the 50s, to a modern dusted off 80ish two-piece set.
Lagerfeld had contributed a lot into the creation of timeless pieces, while keeping in mind the power and popularity of Chanel‚Äôs original idea. 
Lagerfeld understood the highly-exclusive appeal towards the tweed suited style with its antique golden buttons, and has made its personal mission to rejuvenate the idea of the iconic item. He paid tribute to the Mademoiselle's innovative vision, by creating Chanel suits collections from: denim, punk-style tweed, bright neon wool. He had boldly associated the two-piece suit with some Chanel alpine skis.
Lagerfeld was a visionary, the odds thrown at him when he started became his strength, the bet was sucessfully won hands down. Thanks to Lagerfeld, the house name became a trendy brand. Chanel was and not exclusively aimed to eighty years old nble ladies, but to modern succesful working women who loves be √† la mode, and au top de la tendance.  
"Kaiser Karl" as his fashion peers love to call him, found the perfect communication strategy to modernize the brand for good: muses. Ines de la Fressanges was the first Chanel √©gerie, becoming a true amabassador for the brand. She has participated no less than in twenty Chanel fashion shows. The ‚Äô90s supermodels were fashion superstarts, and Karl knew it, 
he had immediately partnered with the most famous ones, big names such as Claudia Schiffer, Christy Turlington, Vanessa Paradis, Linda Evangelista and Carla Bruni, were gracefully representing the emblematic crossed C's collections on every runways, and every fashion weeks, they were photographed and put in the cover of Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, W magazines, wearing preciously picked items that would be displayed in billboards all over the world. 



Anywhere you go in the world, the two crossed C symbols will be recognize. That emblematic logo, is one
 challenging the more conservative past of Chanel.
