Soo where to begin ðŸ˜ƒ,

The 70s period era is itself a cultural reset, on E-V-E-R-Y aspects. Indeed, up until the end of the 60s, minimalism and conformism were paradigms that
rules mostly western societies. Civil Rights were striking at the same moment in the United States, the black community fought, marched, protested, to access to equality
and to end an arbitrary legal system, that were targetting them. The 60s was also the Cold-War era raging against the Western bloc (USA and Europe and its colonzed countries) vs the East bloc (China and USSR). 
At that time, nuclear crisis in Cuba, Vietnam war, Coreas war occured in a very short time span time, students, professors, intellectuals accross the United-States, Europe and particurlaly 
France, showed their anger and exhaustness of unfair wars overseas, political conservative agenda, systemic racism. The 60s was a social flashpoint that caused positive outcomes for
the black community in America, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Jim-Crow-law"> the Jim Crow laws </a> legalizing racial segregations and systemic abuse against them for centuries, had finally being abrogated by the Kennedy administration in 1964.
