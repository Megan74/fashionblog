## Fashion Vita

Having a creative soul in fashion, is having to think through how to match colours, fabrics, motifs, the geometrical shapes, then also having to check the weather, the seasons the trends, the upcoming designers. 

Being up to date with the latest trends, by visioning fashion shows in Milan, Paris NYC, London, by reading fashion blogs and get THAT magical piece that will make your outfit go marverlously. 

As a fashion lover, I love to draw and imagine which dress will I wear for a special event, and tune them with the appropriate heels, to coordinate impeccably the outfit. Being ressed to kill if you will. 

Fashion is just my Vibe. I am not afraid to express that side of myself, by dressing sexy and boldly. 

Weather and trends are indeed among my picking components, but I also pick my clothes according to my moods at the time. 

One day, I feel dressing very girly, very pinky and the other, I can go out with the absolute and most tom boyish attire ever: XXL punk rock t-shirt design with a torn-up to pieces 3/4 boyfriend jean and platform Dr. Martens.

I just go with how my mind flows at the moment. My fashion moods are mostly intertiwned with the various musical inspirations I had growing up: 

My music tastes are ecclectic and contain a wide range of various music genres.

From Mary J. Blige, passing by Radiohead and the Cure. Music as fashion possess a place has grand in my life.

Intertwine them two, to draw clothes pieces, go shopping, and getting an outfit to go outside, is also taking its inspiration through the musical bands
I am listening to, their universes, the genre where they belong.

For example,

- the Goth fashion: I always been drawn by that universe, with their maximalist makeups and hairstyles. Their metallic huge platforms boots with, worn with extra large black pants and chains. As a huge fan of The cure band and their melancholic sounds,
 had given me many ideas through the years, to dress.
