# My art

I love clothes, shoes, accessories According to seasons, moods, social settings, I will assemble pieces together, so the final outcome
may be ehthereal and spectacular. As long as I feel good about myself and my body, I do not have any fear to spark reactions or get attention. I dress for myself and to express through my outfits.

As painters use canvas, music composers use notebooks, graphic designers their graphic tablets, me a fashionista will collect my favourite pieces and put them together during events, ceremonies, dinners.

## Fashion Vita

Having a creative soul in fashion, is having to think through how to match colours, fabrics, motifs, the geometrical shapes, then also check the weather, the seasons. Being up to date with the latest trends. 

I love to draw, and imagine which dress will I wear for a special event and which heels will coordinate the outfit, haircut, jeweleries, and which bag will wrap the outcome.

Fashion is just my vibe. I am not afraid to express that side of me by dressing sexy, boldly. You will never predict what I will chose everyday, it is not also linked with the weather
trends, I relate my clothing to my mood. One day I dress very girly very pinky, the other I go out in a tom boyish way: XXL t-shirt with a punk design with a teared-up boyfriend jean and some all star converses.

I just go with how my mind flow at the moment, I am very inspired by differents fashion currents: 

-Goth/dark universe: I always been drawn by their makeups hairstyles, platforms boots with tons of metallic bits. Them always being
dressed in black is also what I love, and why I get inspired by it a lot. Black goes with everything, can be worn in diffrent season and Never
get out of style.

-Punk rock world: it not just a sense of style I love and respect about the movement, is also their political stand. The punk movement emerged in England, during the 7Ã s economic crisis that striked the country.
Margareth Thatcher Prime Minister at the time, launched offensive measures against miners and workers to face the economic challenges, by closing whole industries and left thousands workers without job, and 
social infrastructures to help them bouncing back in the job market. Her politic with deeply conservative values, created unprecedetent chaos, huge strikes, riots, even Queen Elizabeth II distanced herself from the PM, and nudged her to quit.
By the time all of this happened, the punk movement was born: members created a way to express their anger and disarray against the government, by dressing ostentatively. Pinky hair, chains all over the pant, huge platform, pierccing all over the face and ears
tattoes, that movement showed how anti conservative they were. How the establishment led by Margarreth Thatcher always in lined, with proper rules, in grey boring suits, was everything the punk members fight against.
By going out dressing that boldly, they made sure to demonstrate their miscontentment. Is was not only the clothes, music art, everything was created from their anger, best rock bands in history were created "thanks" to the restrictive and anti social politics from 10th Downing street.
So yes I am fairly and fondly inspired by the punk rock movement, and its history. I sometimes wear platforms boots with teared up jeans, or will wear fake nose piercing, I listen Black Sabbath to this day 
and being borrowing pant chains from my brother at times. They are my heroes.
