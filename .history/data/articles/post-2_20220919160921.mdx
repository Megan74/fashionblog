My fashion inspirations as my music taste, are so vast. 

Every artistic movements have found its source and have emerged, from the most difficult historical period eras/events or crisis. Creativity unearths its most marvelous discoveries and masterpieces, through pain, anger, sadness & suffering. 

The Punk rock world is sadly not an exception. 

I am not just obsessed with their signature boots, the infamous Dr. Martens, or their unique and provocative way of dressing, that goes indeed waaaay beyond that. 

The Punk rock movement, is also a political and subversive movement born in Peru in the mid-60s, by the garage rock group named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Saicos" > Los Saicos </a>. Their mythical sound track 'Demolición', became a peruvian anthem for the anti-governement prostesters. 
That brand new artistic movement filled with a sense of justice, feelings of anger and exhaustion, had naturally paralelled a few years later when the oil crisis striked, with the Western countries, and more specifically the United Kingdom. 
Indeed, the punk movement took over massively the country. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqrAPOZxgzU"> The Sex Pistols </a>, legendary punk group from London that was funded in 1975, was created during the economical crisis, and became particularly famous with their political stance against the Monarchy and the Establishment in place, at the time. 

Many of these british rock bands, fought the power through their arts, and unequivocally energized the british citizens that felt unprotected and abused by the Thatcher restrictive measures, and gave them the courage to protest against her targeted politics.
Margareth Thatcher Prime Minister at the time, had launched an offensive politic against miners and workers, to face the economic challenges that the UK had to deal with, by closing whole industries. Consequently, thousands of workers were laid off and had to live without a job, without
any social infrastructures, that would have helped them to bounce back into the job market. Her politics highly drenched into her conservative values, had created unprecedented social chaos, leading to huge strikes and riots accross the whole country. It became so anarchic, that the Queen Elizabeth II, who is constitutionally unallowed to take any political stance, 
had to distance herself from the PM for the first time ever, and nudged her to quit. Punk members, rock musical bands, painters, laid-off workers, the marginalized and the forgotten part of the society, viewed as the pariah by the highest social strat, have finally found their voices to express their anger and disarray against their unfair treatment received by the Government. 

The Punk movement is easily recognizible,

•by their music: up-beat tempo, screaming chorus filled with powerful messages, unique melodies led by a lively electrical guitar.

•by their art: provocative paintings, street wall tags mocking political figures

•and also by their distinguishable attires: By dressing ostentatively, with pinky spicky hair or veryyyy long hair, with metallic chains all over their torn-up pants, wearing huge metallic boots platforms, piercings all over the face and ears, skull tattoes, eye makeup, nail polish, horizontally red and white stripped t-shirts. The Punks' maximalist fashion senses, manage to show how different, subversive and anti-conforimist they are, in comparison with the rest of the society. 

The Conservative "Tory" governement, the Establishment, and the Monarchy, in opposite, have always being represented as a monolith system frozen in time, that refuses to embrace any shape of modernity, and that does not intent to socially advance in sync with its society. Contrarily of the Punks, the Tories are configured to conform and stay in line. They respect strong & rigid rules, in grey boring suits. The values that they defend are in fact, exactly what the punk members are fighting against.



By going out protesting, by screaming through strongly meaningful anti-Tory songs, by dressing with bold clothes pieces, they have made sure to demonstrate their miscontentment throughout the country and beyond borders. Fueled with pain and anger, punk rock music bands have echoed silenced and oppressed voices, and made sure that THIS time, 10th Downing Street and Buckingham Palace, will hear them. 

The merciless thatcherist & reaganist politics, have resulted to the creation of the BEST rock bands in history. 

Art is that powerful expression outlet, that can moves millions and millions of people, for decades and decades, all over the world.
A powerful expression outlet, that can change the future of a country, by sparking that fire inside of any of us, and diametrically shift the history course of oppressively, unfairly ruled nations.

Punks are not only a true source of inspiration fashionably speaking for me, they are my heroes. ❤️❤️❤️
