**record scratch** Let's go back in time üòÄ

Back in the day in the 70s, cocaine was that recreative, fun and go-to drug, that was mainly consumed during parties. The disco era with its overpacked dancefloors, filled with energized acrobatic and fashionable dancers not leaving until dawn, 
and with its sparkly roller rinks, with a glitter ball suspended to the roof with music blasting on hundreds of decibels, was actually the visual symbolism of how coke was used at the time. 
Visually and socially, using cocaine was acceptable and COOL. That image got fastly tainted a few years later, when coke was linked with negative connotations, and had drastically decimated whole communities.

Crack cocaine is a free base form of cocaine, mixed with baking soda. Contrarily of coke, that drug is smoked through a pot, and not sniffed through the nostrils. Its free base property, brings to its user THAT indescribable and instantaneous pleasure. 
The crack cocaine downside, is evidently the addiction fastness, that occured IMMEDIATLY after the first inhalation. It literally only takes one use, to become an addict for the rest of your life. 
The era when using coke was hip, is definately over. Crack cocaine took over as soon as it hit the american streets. That new drug, BULLDOZED the society on a high scale.

What also differentiate the coke with crack cocaine, is the target customer: coke is mainly used by the elites, the yuppies, the beautiful fashion models, the show business world. On the other hands, crack is mainly used by the poorest communities, the most vulnerabe ones, as its price is very affordable. 
Hence, the underprivileged portion of the American society, was sadly the first one hit by the "crack epidemy", and its cataclysmic and irreparable repercussions, that it has ensued. 
The devastating crack addiction consequences, had forced the President Reagan to intervene, and launched a political offensive against that new plague. Yet, his "war on drugs" had not met the population‚Äôs expectations, the drug plague had worsened, as none of his measures were adequate enough to contain it. 
His brutal politics got worse, because instead of providing an appropriate care system and assistance infrasctructures to rehabilitate the drug addicts, his politics purposely antagonized, demonized and criminalized a whole social group.

That group that the Reagan administration had in aim, you have perfectly guessed, was the Black community (BC).
The crack epidemy PLUS on top of that the anti-drug war, launched by the government, scourged from near and far the community in its entirety. Families were decimated, either with overdose deaths, extremely severe and unjust jail sentences or gang assassinations.
Thousands of children, have lost relatives, parents due to that plague. Some of these new orphans have been placed by the Child Protective Services (CPS), to selectively picked families, (foster care), until their hit the age majority.
That system ended up been a huge failure, as a consequence of major federal funding cuts and rigid systemic racism, that had for mission to purposefully neglect specific communities.
The child welfare system firstly initiated on the sole purpose to protect these newly placed kids, was sadly conducted <a href="https://imprintnews.org/child-welfare-2/nearly-half-of-children-experience-cps-investigations/57396 "> more violence </a> to them. Physical and sexual abuses inflicted to foster kids, were frequently reported to the authorities.
These orphan children who have already seen horrors and unspeakable tragedies throughout their early lives, had to endure furthermore abuse from their new caretakers, with questionable motives, who at the end, have surely signed up to collect their federal cheques. 
After they hit the majority, these kids were then thrown out off that failed system, without any social safety net nor a proper reinsertion structure. Most of them had not even finished high school, nor having the possibility to access to a higher education system to get a valuable degree, that would safely equip them to face the society's challenges, and secure a good future.
Sadly, many of them ended up affiliated to street gangs to create a sense of belongingness (my fingers sprained while writting that ugly world) and some of them have developed severe post-traumatic stress disorder due to years of abuse and neglect, and had to mentally cope with drug and alcohol that unavoidably led them to severe addictions. 
Tragically, some of them have ended up in jail or passed away, with either one of the reasons precedingly mentioned before. 


Instead of strengthening the government institutions to protect them from any corruption attempts. Instead of helping the youth living in these vulnerable areas, directly exposed to violence, poverty, drug trafficking, by funding educational public services aimed to facilitate them to access to higher education systems.
Instead of going at the drug problem's source itself, which is poverty and creating effective ressources to reduce the income inequalities, the US government had treated the crack epidemy, in an uneccessary and repressive way, by funding billions of dollars on law enforcements and extremely punitive measures, at the extent of BC.
The political agenda held by the Reagan administration, and its Republican minions at the Congress, was only to stay in power, nothing more. The drug problem was factually not discriminating, it has demolished families and communities across the whole country, most particularly the poorest part of America, either they were mostly black or white.
Indeed, the Native Americans, Latino communities, White communities living in low-income rural areas, were also devastated by the drug addiction problem.
So the agenda was clear: target only one category, the one that was historically owned as property and treated as such, the one that is the most hated and resented. 
Targeting them, by amplifying the voters emotions and reactions, so it can rally up and vote for the toughest legislations to "fix the issue. Targeting them through the media, press, radio, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQXgVM30mIY"> TV ads </a>, with dog whistle messages, that cognitively intensifies ingrained negative stereotypes against black people.¬†
The Reagan administration got all the ammunitions to bully and harass the BC, with brutal law enforcement, while the drug problem was firstly a national issue.

THAT all above, is the political context, where the Hip Hop Rap culture popped up. These DISMAL circumstances give you relief (a pretty graphic one), and a better understanding, of how one the most impactful artistic movement was formed. As punk rock, hip-hop was born in the 70s, in the Bronx, a rough area in New-York. That movement have like many others emerged through pain, violence, and injustice. 
Indeed, rap music is artistically evoking, every difficult themes, the BC is facing on the daily basis. Philadelphia, NYC, Baltimore, the West Coast, and the Southern part of the US, felt an immediate connection with that new art, and created later on as well on their sides, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1079761477/snoop-dogg-now-owns-death-row-records"> their own hip-hop divisions </a>.   
The hip-hop culture rapidly became a global trend, an expressive alternative to deal with gang violence, police brutality, the crack plague devastating families, unfair & unbalanced justice system that bullies poor and/or Afro-Americans citizens. All the suffering was put into rhyming speeches going with an unique melody mixed with 70s sampled music tracks, purposelly scrapped sounds made by DJs on turntables.
Hip-Hop music is also about the art of freestyling. Spewing rhyming words as poetry, right out of your mouth, that came right out of your mind without rehearsals or previous writing, and on a specific cadence, is TRUE talent. The East Coast vs West Coast war led by the hisyoricl nemesis, Biggie and Tupac, gave us the most provocative, brutal, and insightful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU"> freestyles EVER </a>, like litteral cultural earthquakes ü§Ø. 

Hip-Hop is soooooooooooooooooo vast culturally speaking, that it even possesses a subculture (that I will sadly go through partly, otherwise that post will never see the light of the day, as there are so much to talk about): beatboxing, break dancing, graffiti art in street walls, rap slang/AAVE languages, fashion styles. 

African-American Vernacular English¬†(AAVE) is an American dialect used by the BC, it has been created and used by the slaves in plantations to resist cultural assimilation and maintain a distinct cultural identity. AAVE is still in use by the BC, and it is characterized with a mix of Caribbean creole languages, a mix of purposely altered vocabulary/grammar/conjugation, purposeful words switch in sentences (‚Äúwhere you AT?‚Äù), and a recognizable accent and syllable intonations. 
AAVE is so influential that the biggest advertisement companies get to use them to launch multi-million dollars global marketing campaigns. AAVE even had its own <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=urbandictionary"> website</a>, where every term is explained and put into context (used mostly by adults to stay trendy üòÇ). 
‚ÄúSalty‚Äù, ‚Äúwoke‚Äù, ‚Äúbae‚Äù, ‚Äúshook‚Äù, ‚Äúcrib‚Äù, "cool‚Äù, come from AAVE. Hip hop artists, are using that dialect on the daily basis. As writers and creators themselves, it became natural for them to invent and implement brand new words and new meanings into the AAVE language: ‚Äúgoon‚Äù, ‚Äúbeef‚Äù, ‚Äúsnitch‚Äù, ‚Äúchill‚Äù, ‚Äúcrew‚Äù, ‚Äúfresh‚Äù, ‚Äúvibe‚Äù, ‚Äúfeds‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äù, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs break it down‚Äù.

The hip-hop culture massively influenced the fashion world as we know it today. Firstly viewed as violent gang members, criminals and murderers, hip-hop artists are finally recognized by other artistic fields. 
They are even collaborating with each others: Run DMC, a 80s rap group from Queens, NYC, was the first hiphop group to sign a deal with a clothing brand. Their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNua1lFDuDI"> My Adidas</a>, influenced a whole generation. That song has pushed its audience to buy adidas sneakers, so everytime they were playing that song at their live concerts the public got to remove their brand new Adidas sneakers, to wave them in the air as they sang along. The cultural impact was so huge, 
that the Adidas brand saw a marketing opportunity to partner with the legendary group, with a 1 million dollar contract deal. 
Louis Vuitton another historical house, partnered with Kanye West in 2009. They jointly launched a pair of sneakers named Jasper sneaker. Fashion is a huge component in the culture: saggy pants, durags, cap worn upside down, bucket hat, tracksuits ensemble and of course SNEAKERS. 
Sneakers were at first exclusively worn by basketball players. During the 70s-80s era, as Hip-Hop made its first appearance, the ‚ÄúChucks‚Äù, the Adidas superstars, the Nike Cortez, were all worn by superstars like Run DMC rap members,  LL Cool J, and famously worn by passionate break dancers. 
Jewelleries necklaces, rings, sneakers, hats, are as important as the outfit itself. Hiphop artists had the flair to show ostentatively their wealth. The richer the artist is, the more jewels diamonds rings,
