Soo where to begin üòÉ

Un peu d'histoire: 

The 70s period era is a cultural reset, on E-V-E-R-Y aspects. Indeed, up until the end of the 60s, minimalism and conformism were paradigms that
mostly rule the Western societies. Many social risings and social outbursts emerged right before the 70's era arrives:

‚Ä¢ The Civil Rights movement was striking in the United States, at that moment. The Afro-american community fought, marched, protested, for equality
and had never rested until the US governement ends its arbitrary legal system, that constantly and unfairly targeted them.

‚Ä¢ The Cold-War was at that time, raging for two long decades against the Western bloc (USA and Europe and its colonzed countries) vs the Eastern bloc (China and USSR). The nuclear crisis in Cuba, the Vietnam war that was still ongoing, the two Coreas war, the soft power struggle between the two blocs, 
all of these tragic events, were occuring in a very very short time span. Consequently, students, professors, intellectuals, anti-war citizens, accross the United-States, Europe and particurlaly 
in France, showed their extreme anger and exhaustness of these unfair wars overseas, of the political conservative agenda influenced with the american imperialism, of the systemic racism, and european colonialism. 

The 60s was a true social flashpoint, that caused at the end of its decade, a few positive outcomes. After long years of protests for their rights to
be recognized and protected, the Afro-American community finally received, a legislative milestone : <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Jim-Crow-law"> the Jim Crow laws </a>, that legalized racial segregations, hence systemic abuse against the oppressed community for centuries, had been abrogated by the Kennedy administration in 1964.

Wars, imperialism, capitalism, social injustices, poverty.. Long story short, people rised and demanded Changes.

The 70s then slowly arrived, and brought with them to start the decade in a new lens, a fresh new movement: brand new musics, whole new outfits, unique new designs, a cultural reset
that had drawn a distinct line between the traumatizing past and the future, to finally move on.

That new decade, was symbolic in so many ways: the social changes that got promulgated and these few new inches of freedom, had to be expressed in an emblematic way.

Culturally, artistically the 70s was an inspirational source to say the least. The disco music was created at that period in New York: that new genre 
characterized by an up-beat and groovy tempo, that was specifically created to dance and escape from the dark reality, especially when you are a minority. Indeed, disco was at first, played by Djs in gay bars/night clubs.
That incredibly catchy music genre, has fastly started to become a real phenomenon. Grace Jones, Liza Minnelli, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Salvadore Dali, John Travolta, Bianca Jagger, Andy Warhol, Diana Ross and many others celebrites, had to reunite to New York at least once to the most infamous and exclusive night club ever, <a href="https://cfda.com/news/cfda-decades-the-seventies-disco-glitter-studio-54"> the Studio 54 </a>, 
to D-A-N-C-E until the sun rises. Detroit, industrial city in Michigan, is not only known for being the General Motor's fiefdom, but also known to have signed the most prominent music artists the planet has ever known.
And with the disco music entering into the world's ears, Motown records had kept pushing the most talented bands into  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_s9QFJUTZ4"> our today's playlist </a>. 
Motown represented artists like : the Jackson 5, The Commodores, Rick James, the Supremes, the Temptations, Earth Wind and Fire, Donna Summer.


Passing from discrete black or white, minimalist outfits... To looooong flare plants, colourful and eye-catching pattern blouses with immense collars, and heels PLUS platform boots, on top of it. 
The 70s, also showed a spectacularly way to approch fashion. The maximalist, vibrating and daring outfits were so impactful, that the biggest fashion design houses, are still inspired by that time period
to create high-end pieces for their collections: Valentino, Gucci, Yves Saint-Laurent, Versace, to name a few.

So YES, the 70s, have a huge place in my heart, in terms of culture and fashion. My long purple flare pants, extravaganza golden high heels that I love to wear with a combisuit, and a bandana in my hair, with tons of golden jeweleries.
Cannot tell you all otherwise. I litterally cannot count the amount of colourful 70s inspired crop-tops that I have in my closet. I have never felt so hot and more feminine, than the the moment I curl my hair to get the same perm as Donna Summer and Farrah Fawcett. 

The 70s is my favourite cultural era, hands down. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
