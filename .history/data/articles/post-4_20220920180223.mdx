**record scratch** Let's go back in time 😀

Back in the day in the 70s, cocaine was that recreative, fun and go-to drug that was consumed during parties: the disco era with its overpacked dancefloors filled with energized acrobatic and fashionable dancers not leaving until dawn, and its sparkly roller rinks with a glitter ball suspended to the roof,
 with music blasting on hundreds of decibels, was actually the visual symbolism of how coke was used at the time. 
Visually, socially cocaine was acceptable and COOL. That image got fastly tainted a few years later, when coke was linked with negative connotations and had drastically decimate whole communities.

Crack cocaine, is a free base form of cocaine mixed with baking soda. Contrarily of coke, that drug is smoked through a pot, and not sniffed through the nostrils. Its free base property, brings to its user THAT indescribable and instantaneous pleasure. 
The crack cocaine downside : is evidently, the addiction fastness, that occured RIGHT after the first inhalation, it only takes one use to become an addict for the rest of your life. 

The era when using coke was hip is definately over, crack cocaine took over as soon as it hit the american streets. That new drug, BULLDOZED the society on the high scale.

What also differentiate the coke with crack cocaine, is also is targeted consumers: the first one is mainly used by the elites, the yuppies, the show business world. The second one on the other hands, is mainly used by the poorest communities, the most vulnerabe ones, as its price is very affordable. 
Hence, the underprivileged portion of the American society, were the first hit by the "crack epidemy" and its cataclysmic and irreparable repercussions, that it has ensued. 
President Reagan, had to intervene and launch a political offensive against that new plague. Yet, his "war on drugs" had not met the population’s expectations, the drug plague had worsened, with no adequate measures to contain it. 
His brutal politic got worse because instead of providing an appropriate care system and assistance infrasctructures to rehabilitate, the drug addicts, his politics had purposely antagonized, demonized and criminalized a whole social group.
That group that the Reagan administration had in aim, you have perfectly guessed, was the Black community (BC).
The crack epidemy PLUS the anti-war drugs launched by the government, scourged from near and far that community in its entirety. Families were decimated, either with overdose deaths, extremely severe and unjust jail sentences, gang assassinations, and so on and so far.

Thousands of children, have lost relatives, parents due to that plague. Some of these new orphans have been placed by the Child Protective Services (CPS), to selectively picked families, foster care, until their hit the majority.
That system ended up been a huge failure, as a consequence of major federal funding cuts and a rigid systemic racism at the time, that purposefully neglect specific communities.
The child welfare system firstly initiated on the sole purpose to protect these newly placed kids, was sadly conducted <a href="https://imprintnews.org/child-welfare-2/nearly-half-of-children-experience-cps-investigations/57396 "> more violence </a>, physical and sexual abuses inflicted to foster kids, were frequently reported to the authorities.
These orphan children who have already seen horrors and unspeakable tragedies throughout their early lives, had to endure furthermore abuse from their new caretakers, with questionable motives, who at the end, have surely signed up to collect their federal cheques. 
After they hit the majority, these kids were then thrown out off that failed system, without any social safety net nor a proper reinsertion structure. Most of them had not even finished high school, nor having the possibility to access to a higher and valuable educational degree, that would safely equip them to face the society's challenges, and secure a good future.
Sadly, many of them ended up affiliated to street gangs to create a sense of belongingness (my fingers sprained while writting that ugly world), some of them have developed severe post-traumatic stress disorder, due to years of abuse and neglect, and had to mentally cope with drug and alcohol, that unavoidably led them to severe addictions. 
And tragically, some of them have ended up in jail or passed away, with either one of the reasons precedingly mentioned before. 


Instead of strengthening the government institutions to protect them from any corruption attempts. Instead of helping the youth living in these vulnerable areas, directly exposed to violence, poverty, drug trafficking, by funding educational public services aimed to facilitate them to access to higher education systems.
Instead of going at the drug problem's source itself, which is poverty and creating effective ressources to reduce the income inequalities, the US government had treated the crack epidemic in an uneccesserary repressive way, by funding billions of dollars on law enforcements and extremely punitive measures, at the extent of BC.
The political agenda held by the Reagan administration, and its republican minions in the Congress, was only to stay in power, nothing else. The drug problem was not discriminating, it has demolished families and communities across the whole country, most particularly the poorest part of America.
the Native Americans, Latino communities, White communities living in low-income rural areas, were also devastated by the drug addiction problem.

So the agenda was clear: target only one category, the one that was historically owned as property and treated as such, the one that is the most hated and resented. 
Targeting them, by amplifying the voters emotions and reactions so it can rally and vote for the toughest legislations to "fix the issue. Targeting them through the media, press, radio, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQXgVM30mIY"> TV ads </a>, with dog whistle messages, that cognitively intensifies ingrained negative stereotypes against black people. 
The Reagan administration got all the ammunitions to bully and harass the black communities, with brutal law enforcement, while the drug problem was a national issue.

THAT is the political context, where the Hip Hop Rap culture popped up. These despicable circumstances give you relief (a pretty graphic one, I'll admit), and a better understanding, of how one the most impactful artistic movement was formed. As punk rock, hip-hop was born in the 70s, in the Bronx a rough area in New-York. That movement have like many others emerged through pain, violence, and injustice. 
Indeed, rap music is artistically evoking, every difficult theme, BC is facing on the daily basis. Philadelphia, NYC, Baltimore, the West Coast, and the Southern part of the US, felt an immediate connection with that new art, and had created later on as well on their sides, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1079761477/snoop-dogg-now-owns-death-row-records"> their own hip-hop divisions </a>.   
The hip-hop culture rapidly became a global trend, an expressive alternative to deal with gang violence, police brutality, the crack plague devastating families, unfair & unbalanced legal treatment when poor and Afro-Americans. All the suffering was put into rhyming speeches going with a melody, that gave inspiration to DJs scrapping with turntables, and mixing 70s sampled music tracks at their own sauce, that have created the most provocative, brutal, and insightful <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/best-hip-hop-radio-freestyles/" > freestyles ever </a>. 

Hip-Hop is soooooooooooooooooo vast culturally speaking, that it even possesses a subculture (that I will sadly go through partly, otherwise that post will never see the light of the day as there are so much to talk about): beatboxing, break dancing, graffiti art in street walls, rap slang/AAVE languages, fashion styles. 

African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is an American dialect used by the BC, it has been created and used by the slaves in plantations, then used until now. AAVE is characterized with a mix of Caribbean creole languages, a mix of purposely altered vocabulary/grammar/conjugation, purposeful words switch in sentences (“where you AT?”), and a recognizable accent and syllable intonations. 
AAVE is so influential that the biggest advertisement companies get to use them, to launch multi-million dollars global marketing campaigns. AAVE even had its own <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=urbandictionary"> website</a>, where every term is explained and put into context (used mostly by adults to stay trendy I would say 😂). 
“Salty”, “woke”, “bae”, “shook”, “crib”, "cool”, come from AAVE. Hip hop artists, are using that dialect on the daily basis. As writers themselves, it became natural for them to invent and implement brand new words and new meanings into the language: “goon”, “beef”, “snitch”, “chill”, “crew”, “fresh”, “vibe”, “feds”, “don’t get it twisted”, “let’s break it down”.

The hip-hop culture massively influenced the fashion world that we know today. Firstly viewed as violent gang members, criminals and murderers, hip-hop artists are finally recognized by other artistic fields. 
They are even collaborating with each others: indeed, Run DMC, a 80s rap group from Queens, NYC, was the first hiphop group to sign a deal with a fashion brand. Their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNua1lFDuDI"> My Adidas</a>, influenced a whole generation. That song has pushed people to buy adidas sneakers, and everytime they played that song at their live concerts, the public was literally removing their Adidas sneakrs to wave them in the air. The cultural impact was so huge, that Adidas saw an opportunity to partner with the legendary group with a 1 million dollar deal. 
Louis Vuitton partnered with Kanye West in 2009, they launched a pair of sneakers named Jasper sneaker [ https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/_Louis-Vuitton-x-Kanye-West-Jasper-Patchwork-or-Size-6.5  ]. Kanye was not a pioneer in the fashion partnership landscape. Fashion is a huge component in the culture, saggy pants, durags, cap worn upside down, bob hat, tracksuits ensemble and of course SNEAKERS. 
Sneakers were at first exclusively worn by basketball players. During the 70s-80s era, as Hip-Hop made its first appearance, the “Chucks”, the Adidas superstars, the Nike Cortez, were all worn by superstars like Run DMC rap members,  LL Cool J, and famously worn by any the break dancers. 

oyant l’ampleur du phénomène, la marque aux trois bandes signe dans la foulée un contrat avec RUN DMC dont le montant s’élève à 1 million de dollars. Cet endorsement deal va ouvrir la voie à d’autres partenariats avec plusieurs artistes dans le futur à l’instar de Kanye West, Pharrell Williams ou bien Beyoncé.

PMany have drawn their inspirations from it,
