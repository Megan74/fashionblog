Soo where to begin ðŸ˜ƒ

Un peu d'histoire: 

The 70s period era is itself a cultural reset, on E-V-E-R-Y aspects. Indeed, up until the end of the 60s, minimalism and conformism were paradigms that
rules mostly western societies. Many social risings and outbursts emerged right before the 70S arrive.

Civil Rights were striking at that moment in the United States. The black community fought, marched, protested, for equality
and to end the arbitrary legal system, that was constantly and unfairly targetting them. The Cold-War raging against the Western bloc (USA and Europe and its colonzed countries) vs the East bloc (China and USSR), for two long decades now. 

The uclear crisis in Cuba, the Vietnam war that was still ongoing, the two Coreas war, the soft power struggle between the two blocs, all of these events were occuring in a very very short time span time. Consequently, students, professors, intellectuals all accross the United-States, Europe and particurlaly 
in France, showed their extreme anger and exhaustness of these unfair wars overseas, the political conservative agenda influenced with the american imperialism, and the systemic racism, and european colonialism. The 60s was a true social flashpoint, that caused at the end positive outcomes for
the black community in America: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Jim-Crow-law"> the Jim Crow laws </a> that legalized the racial segregation and systemic abuse against the oppressed community for centuries, had finally being abrogated by the Kennedy administration in 1964.

Wars, capitalism, social injustice, poverty.. Long story short people rised and demanded changes.

The 70s, slowly arrived and brought with them to start the decade in a new lens, a new movement, new musics, new outfits, new designs, a cultural reset
to draw a distinct line between the past and now.


That new decade, was symbolic in every way, social changes that got promulgated and these few inches of freedom, had to be expressed in a very symbolic way.

Passing from discrete minimalist outfit... To long flare plants, colourful and eye-catching blouses with patterns and immense collars, heels PLUS platform boots, on top of it.




Detroit, industrial city in Michigan is not only known for being General Motor's fiefdom, but also to have signed the most prominent music artist the planet ever known.
