Nothing inspires me more than strong, successful women. For a very long time, that archetype has only been limited to the male paradigm of power suits in a board room.
I am more drawn into the role of the Seductress, the Bimbo. Goddess women who have reached the top, by breaking molds and embracing their sexual allure.
Molds that were specifically designed for women, molds with societal features that give them a sole and only life purpose, being a wife, mother.

" We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
“You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man”
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach to aspire to marriage
And we don’t teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes ""


Does this insightful speech is familiar to you? Yes? Exactly, it is the introduction of Beyonce “Flawless” ’s song, launched 10 years ago. 
A sample directly pulled from the Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s TEDxTalk speech held in London: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc"> « We Should All be Feminists.» </a>.
A speech that underlines the society endoctrinations of young girls.



Let’s crop the historical timeline: from the 20th century to now.

At the beginning of that time period and for very long decades, worldwide societies boxed women into one tiny little square, that attributed them one role and only : to be a wife. That indoctrination perpetuated from the early age, gravitated the woman existence towards men. 
Not around herself as an individual humain being, capable of critical thinking, possessing her own hobbies, aspirations, ambitions etc. No not at all. Her whole existence, her finale goal has to get married. After being married, women second essential role was to be a mother, to have kids, to be a housewife that take care of the home. Her sole identity was at that time, to be a mother, to be a wife which is ok, but many of these women during that time period, were trapped into a destructive societal square. An abusive, unchosen, unloved, unfulfilling prison. Society, had purposely silenced women, prevented them from expressing themselves, from complaining, from showing any relent of negative emotions, JUST gratefulness and that’s it. The « Glorious Thirties » accentuated that phenomenon and gaslit on high scale the women’s unfair conditions, with advertisement campaigns, pushing the image of the happy housewife receiving a brand new washing machine, and other revolutionary kitchen devices, to facilitate her cleaning/cooking tasks. 

On top that that tiny little square they spent all their lives in, women were stripped down from their rights to vote. If they had the possibility to work they could, but they were not allowed to access to any roles with high responsibilities nor decisions-making positions. They had to tolerate in silence, constant harassment (sexually & psychologically), at work without any repercussions. From a very long time, Society shoved brutal values into women’s throat, and forced them to nod their head, smile and being grateful to get the life patriarchy chose for them. The Happy housewife image displayed in every billboard, magazines, TV commercials, was a toxic narrative, that pushed many of them to depression, alcoholism, pain killers anti-anxiolytic addictions, to numb their extreme despair, solitude, and fill the misery society pushed them in.

« The Stepford wives », a novel book written by Ira Levin in 1972,  decrypts exactly that sad phenomenon on a satyrical tone. Joanna Eberhart, a talented photographer, wife and young mother decides to move to Stepford, a Connecticut suburb, with her hubby and kids. In Joanna’s new town's idyllic facade, lies a terrible secret: she suspects the submissive housewives to be robots created by their husbands..


-revolution culturelle émancipation sexuelle feminist pioneers

Ever since of the beginning of the XXth century, women fought for their human rights, the Suffragettes fought for women to participate in the political lives. Women fought to create their own lanes at their reputations’ & lives’ expense, so the future generations can have the freedom to become whoever they want to be, without letting society and its patriarchic’s tentacles ostracises them. Treated for decades as breeding stock, as home-task programming robot (as Stepford wives), these deeply hurtful narratives have progressively been dismantled. Thanks to the life-long feminists activists, human rights advocates and also thanks to influential women, that were absolutely not afraid to speak up and break societal codes. 

The women’ fate has immensely evolved through the cultural lens, thanks to many public figures that I show a tremendous respect for. 

Josephine Baker was born out of wedlock in 1906 and into the impoverished, racist ghetto of St. Louis, Missouri. She dropped out of school at 13 and supported herself by waitressing and dancing on street corners, and by the age of 15, was twice divorced. Yet despite her dismal youth, she maintained an optimistic view about her potential. She eventually ended up to New York City during the Harlem Renaissance. Here she performed in a number of clubs and Broadway theatres, where she became “the highest-paid chorus girl in vaudeville.” 
Throughout it all, Baker remained driven and impassioned by her love of the stage and dance—which she performed with uninhibited erotic zeal. According to her sister, Margaret, she had "set out to conquer the world."  For over a century, Black women performers have challenged racism, sexism, and heteronormativity. However, the ephemeral traces of historical performances are always in danger of being erased or misinterpreted. In the 1920s and 1930s, Josephine Baker both shocked and delighted audiences at Parisian dance halls with her scandalous banana belt. For many critics, the belt symbolizes either her agency or her submission to primitivist caricature and racial/sexual objectification. Instead, through what I call female phallicism,
 I theorize the belt as a multiple dildo harness that intervened in complex ways in colonial racial and sexual discourses. The banana belt offers contemporary critics a multidimensional, dialogic space for dismantling racial and sexual hierarchies.


In a similar vein as Baker, Eartha Kitt famous actress and singer, broke the mold, she was put in, and created her own lane where she followed her own rules. The "Santa Baby" singer was so much more than a captivating entertainer, she was also a Civil Rights advocate, an international political provocateur whose career was nearly ruined after she condemned the Vietnam War.
Indeed, as a subversive black icon, Eartha empowered and inspired many. Any of her public political stances, would be immediately followed, and decrypted. By being fearlessly outspoken, and openly criticising controversial politics led by the government, as the Vietnam war that was raging at that moment,  by pointing out how destructive and unnecessary that political choice was, the CIA put her on their watchlist. « The most exciting woman of the world » as the Citizen Kane movie director, Orson Welles,  loved to describe her, was born in a slavery plantation in South Carolina, in january 1927. 9 months after her mother, a slave had been raped by her master.. 
Her life trajectory took an incredible and miraculous turn,  as she becomes a symbol representing sex positivity, feminism and fight for any type of justice. 

Josephine, Eartha, paved an unimaginable path to desperate, unfulfilled, intrepid, incredibly smart women, that felt unchained and lost. Marylin Monroe followed as well these pioneers in the entertaining industry, that break codes and follow her own destiny. She was not a « brainless broad » that was used, marketed for men. She was extremely smart, thought real quick out of the box, and knew how to control efficiently her image.  The kind of  fiery personality that is ahead of her time. 
 At the time, racial segregation was still legal, but it has not stopped Monroe to use her power and influence to help her friend, Ella Fitzgerald jazz music singer, by redirecting the spotlight to her art and her immense talent. Ella Fitzgerald, was struggling getting live performance gigs in exclusive jazz clubs, due to the colour of her skin and her prominent body figure. Marylin her friend becoming aware of her friend’s unfair treatment, called jazz music clubs, and asked them to let Ella perform in exchange of her, coming to most of her shows with many of her famous contacts from her carnet d’address. 
 The most racist, misogynistic jazz club owner, would be absolutely stupid to turn down such a gigantic opportunity. Receiving that amount of publicity and spotlight at their establishments, by being associated with the most talked-about woman of all time, is a shot that cannot be refused.
  Thanks to Marylin and her fearless mind, Ella career trajectory took another dimension. Marylin’s allyship, and their sincere friendship, finally gave to Ella the recognition and respect, she truly deserves from the industry.  The clueless blonde stereotype that the media loved to portray her all her life, and career, was certainly overplayed,. Marylin was more than what magazines, tabloids, depicted her to be. 
  Indeed, as she became a global sensation, she absolutely knew with who she will partner with and how to associate her «  Bimbo » image, for post-mortem prosperity, and code-breaking legacy: she became the face of the worlwide perfume besteller chanel n°5 , after her daring Life magazine interview(chanel post).  She was a true public relation machine. 
  Collaborated with the french designer Thierry Mugler, Andy Warhol, the biggest film directors as Alfred Hitchcock, who once said «  Marylin has sex written all over her face ». Marilyn Monroe is an actress that has stayed in the spotlight across all generations. Monroe belongs to that wave of women unapologetically using their sexuality as a tool in creativity.

During the 70s, a whole new genre of movies directed and produced by black people and for black people emerged, and become a true success across the United-States. The « Blaxploitation »,  movie production companies, alternative to Hollywood, produced highly entertaining (but poorly written though) movies like Shaft, Blacula, etc. 
Thanks to that new artistic wave, a trans-generational icon is born: Pam Grier heart eyes. Pam Grier, becomes the Blaxploitation’s face, a black woman sex-symbol, that whole generations fantasised over. She rapidly becomes the most popular movie stars of her era. With her voluptuous body figure, Pam enrolled in movie characters that are mostly independent, fearless, combative, characters that would not hesitate to kick bad guys asses in her nylon jumpsuit with a mesmerising cleavage, plus huge platform boots. 
I mean there you have it, the perfect combination of all the ingredients to make a successful movie. As Marylin Monroe, Pam embodies that powerful, irresistible woman, that had kicked the patriarchal door down, and made the life she has decided for herself. By being fearless, and unapologetic, these women have inspired and empowered young girls who had nobody to identify to. 
Tarantino very successful but very strict and exclusive movie director, had also been seduced by Pam’s career and aura. He immediately picked her in 1997, to film his movie, Jackie Brown, inspired by the Blaxpoitation storylines’ concept.

Bimbos throughout history, such as Anna Nicole Smith, Pamela Anderson, Madonna and their spiritual mother Marylin Monroe,  all these public figures, have owned their sexual & sensuality power and turnt it into a veritable weapon.
 They have spent all their lives breaking codes, wrecking chains, that had imprisoned the previous generations. 

These pop culture icons, not only broke social barriers, they have also inspired generations and generations of women, to not accept to be put into colourless flavourless molds until the rest of their lives. They have paved a way to unapologetically embrace our sexuality and inner fierceness, even though it can make others uncomfortable. To live the life the way any always have imagined, 
without guilt, without being vilified by a part of society, who already have sealed the women’s fate, to fit their agenda.

As a woman, born into african culture with conservative and church led values, that center our education around social shaming, having an extrovert, creative personality was complicated.
 I had somewhat felt guilt for not wanting to fit into that tiny little square that was designed for me. But by growing up, by observing through the media lens, movies, music, and by reading books, I quickly understood, that there were many other ways to be happy, and fulfilled,  than whatever the society had kept harping on and on ever since, we are kids. 
 I am the confident, bold, sharp & strong-minded woman that I am today, thanks to these amazing public figures, thanks to my strong, understanding and incredibly smart mother and all the intelligent independent women in her family’s side, and also by having the chance to live in a democratic modern society that gives women the opportunity to be whoever they intend to be.
