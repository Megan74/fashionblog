Back in the day, cocaine was that recreative, fun and go-to drug that was consumed during parties: the disco era with its overpacked dancefloors filled with acrobatic and fashionable dancers not leaving until dawn, and its sparkly roller rinks with the glitter ball and music blasting on hundreds of decibels, was actually the visual symbolism of how coke was used at the time. 
Way before it became an addiction and drastically decimate the society.

Crack cocaine, is a free base form of cocaine, that instead of coke is smoked and not sniffed through the nose. Its free base property, brings to its user THAT indescribable and instantaneous pleasure. Its downside and the reason why crack cocaine disparage society on the high scale, is how fast the user get addicted, it takes only ONE inhalation to stay addicted for the rest of its life. What also differentiate the coke with crack cocaine, is also is targeted consumers: the first one is mainly used by the elites, the yuppies, the show business world, the second one on the other hands, is mainly used by the poorest communities as its price is affordable. Hence, the most vulnerable parts of the American society were the first hit by the crack epidemy and its cataclysmic repercussions that ensued. President Reagan, had to intervene and launch a political offensive against that new plague: his new wars on drugs had not met the population’s expectations, actually the opposite. It got worse. And had not helped the targeted populations, BUT had in contrary, and purposely, antagonize, demonize and criminalize, an entire group.
That group that the Reagan administration had in aim, you have guessed, was the Black community (BC).
The crack epidemy PLUS the anti-war drugs launched by the government, scourged from near and far the community in its entirety. Families were decimated, either with overdose deaths, jails sentences, gang assassinations, and so on and so far. Thousands of children, have lost relatives and their parents due to that plague, and were placed afterwards by the Child Protective Services (CPS), to selectively picked families, foster care, until their hit the majority. Due to major federal funding cuts, that system ended up been a huge failure itself. That federal program specifically created to protect vulnerable children, had sadly conducted to more violence and physical and even sexual abuse against them [ https://imprintnews.org/child-welfare-2/nearly-half-of-children-experience-cps-investigations/57396 ]. The child welfare system firstly initiated on the sole purpose to project these newly placed kids, had failed to its mission to care and properly assist them they're grown. They have neglected many of these kids, who have already seen horrors and unspeakable tragedies their all lives. They had to endure furthermore abuse from their new caretakers, with questionable motives, who at the end have only signed up to collect federal cheques. After they hit the majority, these kids were thrown out of that failed system without any social safety net for a proper reinsertion structure, to face the society's challenges. Most of them have not even finished high school, nor having the possibility to access to a higher and valuable educational degree, that would safely equip them for their future. Sadly, many of them ended up affiliated to street gangs to belong somewhere, some of them have developed severe post-traumatic stress disorder, due to years of abuse and neglect, and had to cope mentally with drug and alcohol that unavoidably led them to severe addictions. And tragically, some of them have ended up in jail or passed away, with either one of the reasons precedingly mentioned before. That is how destructive and irresponsible, the government had treated the crack epidemic in the 70s. A political agenda held by the Reagan administration and its republican minions in the Congress, to stay in power. The drug problem was not discriminating, it has demolished families and communities all across the country, most particularly the poorest part of America, hence the native Americans, Latinos, White communities in low-income rural areas, and yes also the BC. The agenda was yet clear: target only one category, the one that was historically owned as property and treated as such, the one that is the most hated and resented. Target the most feared one, by amplifying these emotions and reactions to the voters, through media, press, radio, TV ads [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQXgVM30mIY ], with dog whistle messages, that cognitively intensifies the already ingrained negative stereotypes against black people. The Reagan administration got all the ammunitions to bully and harass the black communities, with brutal law enforcement, while the drug problem was a national issue.

THAT is the political context, where the Hip Hop Rap culture popped up. These tragic circumstances give you relief and a better understanding of how one the most impactful artistic movement has erected. As punk rock, hip-hop was born in the 70s in the Bronx, a rough area in New-York. That movement emerged through pain, violence, and injustice. 

Indeed, rap music is artistically evoking, every difficult theme, BC faces on the daily basis. Philadelphia, NYC, Baltimore, the West Coast, and the Southern part of US, felt an immediate connection with that new art, and had created later on as well on their sides, in their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1079761477/snoop-dogg-now-owns-death-row-records"> own zone areas </a>.    

The hip-hop culture rapidly became a global trend, an expressive alternative to deal with gang violence, police brutality, the crack plague devastating families, unfair & unbalanced legal treatment when poor and afro Americans. All the suffering was put into rhyming speeches going with a melody, gave inspiration to DJs scrapping with turntables and mixing 70s sampled music tracks at their own sauce, created the most provocative, brutal, and insightful freestyles ever [https://www.xxlmag.com/best-hip-hop-radio-freestyles/]. Hip-Hop is soooooooooooooooooo vast culturally speaking, that it even possesses a subculture that I’ll sadly go through partly: beatboxing, break dancing, graffiti art in the streets wall, rap slang/AAVE languages, fashion styles. 

African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is an American dialect used by the BC, it has started be used from the slaves in plantations until now. AAVE is characterized with a mix with of Caribbean creole languages, a mix of purposely altered vocabulary/grammar/conjugation, a mix  of purposeful words switch in sentences (“where you AT?”), and a recognizable accent and syllable intonations. AAVE is so influential that the biggest advertisement companies get to use them, to launch global multi-million dollars marketing campaigns. AAVE even had its own website, where every term is explained and put into context (used mostly by adults to stay trendy I would say xD). 
“Salty”, “woke”, “bae”, “shook”, “crib”, 2cool”, come from AAVE. Hip hop artists, are using on the daily basis that dialect, as writers it became natural for them to implement and invent new words and new meanings, as a unifying social system. “Goon”, “beef”, “snitch”, “chill”, “crew”, “fresh”, “vibe”, “feds”, “don’t get it twisted”, “let’s break it down”.

Fashion wise today, the hip-hop influence is still massively talked about, many draw big inspirations from it, first viewed as violent gang members, criminals and killers, hip-hop artists are now collaborating with historical fashion designer houses now. Indeed, RUN DMC  80s rap group from Queens, NYC,  influenced a whole generation with their music,      . Louis Vuitton partnered with Kanye West in 2009, and launched a pair of sneakers named Jasper sneaker [ https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/_Louis-Vuitton-x-Kanye-West-Jasper-Patchwork-or-Size-6.5  ]. Kanye was not a pioneer in the fashion partnership landscape. Fashion is a huge component in the culture, saggy pants, durags, cap worn upside down, bob hat, tracksuits ensemble and of course SNEAKERS. Sneakers were at first exclusively worn by basketball players. During the 70s-80s era, as Hip-Hop made its first appearance, the “Chucks”, the Adidas superstars, the Nike Cortez, were all worn by superstars like Run DMC rap members,  LL Cool J, and famously worn by any the break dancers. 

oyant l’ampleur du phénomène, la marque aux trois bandes signe dans la foulée un contrat avec RUN DMC dont le montant s’élève à 1 million de dollars. Cet endorsement deal va ouvrir la voie à d’autres partenariats avec plusieurs artistes dans le futur à l’instar de Kanye West, Pharrell Williams ou bien Beyoncé.
