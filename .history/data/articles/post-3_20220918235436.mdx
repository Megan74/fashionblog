Soo where to begin üòÉ

Un peu d'histoire: 

The 70s period era is a cultural reset, on E-V-E-R-Y aspect. Indeed, up until the end of the 60s, minimalism and conformism were paradigms that
mostly rule the Western societies. Many social risings and outbursts emerged right before the 70S arrive:

‚Ä¢ Civil Rights were striking in the United States, at that moment. The Afro-american community fought, marched, protested, for equality
and had never rested until the US governement ends its arbitrary legal system, that constantly and unfairly targeted them.

‚Ä¢ The Cold-War was at that time, raging against the Western bloc (USA and Europe and its colonzed countries) vs the East bloc (China and USSR), for two long decades. The nuclear crisis in Cuba, the Vietnam war that was still ongoing, the two Coreas war, the soft power struggle between the two blocs, 
all of these tragic events, were occuring in a very very short time span time. Consequently, students, professors, intellectuals, anti-war citizens, accross the United-States, Europe and particurlaly 
in France, showed their extreme anger and exhaustness of these unfair wars overseas, of the political conservative agenda influenced with the american imperialism, of the systemic racism, and european colonialism. 

The 60s was a true social flashpoint, that caused at the end of its decade, a few positive outcomes. After long years of protests for their rights to
be recognized and protected, the Afro-American community recieved finally a legislative milestone : <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Jim-Crow-law"> the Jim Crow laws </a>, that legalized racial segregations, hence systemic abuse against the oppressed community for centuries, had finally being abrogated by the Kennedy administration in 1964.

Wars, imperialism, capitalism, social injustices, poverty.. Long story short, people rised and demanded Changes.

The 70s then slowly arrived and brought with them, to start the decade in a new lens, a fresh new movement, brand new musics, whole new outfits, unique new designs, a cultural reset
to draw a distinct line between the traumatizing past and future. That new decade, was symbolic in every way, social changes that got promulgated and these few inches of freedom, had to be expressed in a very symbolic way.

Culturally, artistically the 70S was an inspirational shaft to say the least. The disco music was created at that period in New York, an up-beat musics
that was specifically created to dance and escape the dark reality, when you are a minority. Disco was at first played by Djs in gay bars and disco clubs, 
that catchy music genre started to become a phenomenon, that Grace Jones, Liza Minnelli, Mciahel Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Salvadore Dali, John Travolta, Andy Wharol, Diana Ross and many others celebrites had to reunite to New York at least once, in the most infamous and exclusive night club ever, the Studio 54, 
to dance and experiment that brand new musical genre. Detroit, industrial city in Michigan, is not only known for being the General Motor's fiefdom, but it is also known to have signed the most prominent music artists the planet has ever known.
And with the disco music entering into the world ears, Motown records had kept pushing the most talented bands into  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_s9QFJUTZ4"> our today's playlist </a>, by representing artists: like the Jackson 5, The Commodores, Rick James,
the Supremes, the Temptations, Earth Wind and Fire, Donna Summer.


Passing from discrete black or white minimalist outfits... To loppng flare plants, colourful and eye-catching blouses with patterns and immense collars, heels PLUS platform boots, on top of it. The 70s, shows spectacularly 
a way different way to approch fashion. The maximalist, vibrating, daring outfits were so impactful that the biggest fashion design houses, are still inspired by that time period
to create pieces for their collections: Valentino, Gucci, Yves Saint-Laurent, Versace, to name a few.

So yes, the 70s, have a huge place in my heart, when speaking of culture and fashion. My long purple flare pants, extravaganza high heels that I love to wear with a combisuit, and a bandana in my hear, with tons of golden jeweleries.
I cannot count the amount of colourful crop-tops that I have in my closet, feeling so hot and feminine whenever I curl my hair to get the same perm as Donna Summer and Farrah Fawcett. 

The 70s is my favourite cultural era, hands down. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
