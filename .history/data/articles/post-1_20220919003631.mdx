## Fashion Vita

Having a creative soul in fashion, is having to think through how to match colours, fabrics, patterns, the geometrical shapes, then also having to check the weather, the seasons the trends, the upcoming designers. 

Being up to date with the latest trends, by visioning fashion shows in Milan, Paris NYC, London, by reading fashion blogs and get THAT magical piece that will make your outfit go marverlously. 

As a fashion lover, I love to draw and imagine which dress will I wear for a special event, and tune them with the appropriate heels, to coordinate impeccably the outfit. Being ressed to kill if you will. 

Fashion is just my Vibe. I am not afraid to express that side of myself, by dressing sexy and boldly. 

Weather and trends are indeed among my picking components, but I also pick my clothes according to my moods at the time. 

One day, I feel dressing very girly, very pinky and the other, I can go out with the absolute and most tom boyish attire ever: XXL punk rock t-shirt design with a torn-up to pieces 3/4 boyfriend jean and platform Dr. Martens.

I just go with how my mind decides to flow at the moment. My fashion moods are intertiwned with my various musical inspirations. 

As my music tastes are very ecclectic and contain a wide range of various music genres, from different period eras, my fashion choices do go the same.

As I draw clothes, go shopping, or getting the outfit to go outside, the other part of my brain picks in the meantime, the inspiration through the leadsinger from a grundge musical band, from that sensual r&b singer or 
 from a 70s motown disco group.
