My music tastes are ecclectic and contain a wide range of various music genres.

From Mary J. Blige, passing by Radiohead and the Cure. Music as fashion possess a place has grand in my life.

Intertwine them two, to draw clothes pieces, go shopping, and getting an outfit to go outside, is also taking its inspiration through the musical bands
I am listening to, their universes, the genre where they belong.

For example,

- the Goth fashion: I always been drawn by that universe, with their maximalist makeups and hairstyles. Their metallic huge platforms boots with, worn with extra large black pants and chains. As a huge fan of The cure band and their melancholic sounds,
 had given me many ideas through the years, to dress.   

- The Punk rock world: it is not just a sense of style that I love and respect, but it is also a political and subversive movement born in Peru mid-60S by the group named Los Saicos, their mythic sound 'Demolici√≥n', became an anthem for anti-governement prostesters at the time. 
That movement is filled with sense of justice, feelings of anger and exhaustness, so naturally when the oil crisis that striked the all Western countries, especially United Kingdom, in the 70s, the punk movement then took over massively in the country.
Sex Pistols legendary british group was funded and became famous for their political stances against the monarchy and the establishment in place, fought the power through their art and gae courage and energy to british citzens that felt
unprotected and abused by Thatcher restricive measures.

Indeed, Margareth Thatcher Prime Minister, launched offensive measures against miners and workers to face the economic challenges that UK have to deal with: by closing whole industries that left thousands of workers without a job, and 
social infrastructures to help them bouncing back in the job market. Her politics highly drenched into her conservative values, created unprecedetent social chaos leading to huge strikes and riots, accross the country. It became so anarchic, that Queen Elizabeth II, that constitutionnally unallowed to take political stances, 
had to distance herself from the PM for the first time, and nudged her to quit.

Punk members, musical bands, painters, laid-off workers, marginalized part of the society viewed as the pariah by the high strat of society, finally found a beautiful way to express their anger and disarray against their unfair treatments by the government. 
The punk movement is easily recognizible by their up-beat tempo screams, and electrical guitar music melodies, their provocative paintings and wall tags mocking political figures, and also with their maximalist fashion senses. 

By dressing ostentatively, with pinky spiky hair, long hair, chains all over the torn-up pant, huge metallic platforms, piercing all over the face and ears, tattoes, eyes makeup, nail polish, stripped t shirt, the Punks succeeded to show how different, subversive and anti-conforimists they were, compared to the rest of the society. 

The Conservative "Tory" governement, the Establishment, and the Monarchy, have always being represented as a monolith system, frozen in time, that refuse to embrace any modernity or  in lined, with proper rules, in grey boring suits, was everything the punk members fight against.
By going out dressing that boldly, they made sure to demonstrate their miscontentment. Is was not only the clothes, music art, everything was created from their anger, best rock bands in history were created "thanks" to the restrictive and anti social politics from 10th Downing street.
So yes I am fairly and fondly inspired by the punk rock movement, and its history. I sometimes wear platforms boots with teared up jeans, or will wear fake nose piercing, I listen Black Sabbath to this day 
and being borrowing pant chains from my brother at times. They are my heroes.
