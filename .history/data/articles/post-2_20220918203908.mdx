My fashion inspirations as my music taste, are so vast. Every artistic movements found its source and emerge from the most difficult historical period eras/events and crisis.

Creativity unearths its most marvelous discoveries, masterpieces through pain, anger, sadness & suffering.


And the Punk rock world is no exception. I am not just obsessed with their signature boots the Dr. Martens, their unique and provocative way of dressing, that goes beyond that. Indeed, the Punk rock movement is also a political and subversive movement born in Peru, 
mid-60s by the group named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Saicos" > Los Saicos,  their mythic sound 'Demolici√≥n', became an anthem for anti-governement prostesters at the time. 
That movement is filled with sense of justice, feelings of anger and exhaustness, so naturally when the oil crisis that striked the all Western countries, especially United Kingdom, in the 70s, the punk movement then took over massively in the country.
Sex Pistols legendary british group was funded and became famous for their political stances against the monarchy and the establishment in place, fought the power through their art and gae courage and energy to british citzens that felt
unprotected and abused by Thatcher restricive measures.

Indeed, Margareth Thatcher Prime Minister, launched offensive measures against miners and workers to face the economic challenges that UK have to deal with: by closing whole industries that left thousands of workers without a job, and 
social infrastructures to help them bouncing back in the job market. Her politics highly drenched into her conservative values, created unprecedetent social chaos leading to huge strikes and riots, accross the country. It became so anarchic, that Queen Elizabeth II, that constitutionnally unallowed to take political stances, 
had to distance herself from the PM for the first time, and nudged her to quit.

Punk members, musical bands, painters, laid-off workers, marginalized part of the society viewed as the pariah by the high strat of society, finally found a beautiful way to express their anger and disarray against their unfair treatments by the government. 
The punk movement is easily recognizible by their up-beat tempo screams, and electrical guitar music melodies, their provocative paintings and wall tags mocking political figures, and also with their maximalist fashion senses. 

By dressing ostentatively, with pinky spiky hair, long hair, chains all over the torn-up pant, huge metallic platforms, piercing all over the face and ears, tattoes, eyes makeup, nail polish, stripped t shirt, the Punks succeeded to show how different, subversive and anti-conforimists they were, compared to the rest of the society. 

The Conservative "Tory" governement, the Establishment, and the Monarchy, have always being represented as a monolith system, frozen in time, that refuses to embrace any modernity or advance with its time period. In opposite as the Punks, they are configured to conform and stay in line. They respect strong & rigid rules, in grey boring suits. The values they defend are in fact exactly everything the punk members are fight against.

By going out prostesting, by screaming through strongly meaningful anti-Tory songs, by dressing with bold clothes piesces, they have made sure to demonstrate their miscontentment throughout the country and beyond borders. Is was not only the clothes, music art, everything was created from their anger, best rock bands in history were created "thanks" to the restrictive and anti social politics from 10th Downing street.
So yes I am fairly and fondly inspired by the punk rock movement, and its history.

Art, is that powerful expression outlet that can move millions and millions for decades and all over the world, that can also change the future of a country by sparking that fire inside of any of us, and change the course history of oppressive, unfairly ruled countries.

They are my heroes.
