            <p className="pb-2 ">Hi, I am Megan!<br></br>
             A 30 years old bubbly fashion enthusiast.<br></br>
             Ever since I am a kid, conformity has always been a concept,
             that I struggle to wrap my head around. 
             Excentric, with a big personality and a very big imagination,
             my goals have always been centered around the rules that I have specifically designed for my well-being, 
             despite the very perspicuous ones, that society had thrown at me.
             <br></br>Hence, it has been very natural for me to be drawn into art and creativity.
            
             <br></br>In that universe, there are NO rules, NO restrictive access, NO absurd social constructs, JUST pure Freedom.<br></br> 
            Art possesses that anarchistic power that spreads colours, flavours and SOUL, in a black & white, capitalistic, cold world, where social strats and etiquettes prevail.

            <br></br>The beauty in art, is that it gets to touch the humans core soul, no matter the social background, sexual orientation or political/religious beliefs.

            <br></br>A very powerful, timeless, unifiying and healing power ❤️.<br></br>
